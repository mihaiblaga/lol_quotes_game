"Ready to set the world on fire? Heheheh..."
"Going."
"Going."
"I'm on a short fuse."
"Like wildfire."
"Yes..."
"I will blaze a trail."
"You can't contain me, summoner."
"After millennia, I am free!"
"This body is just one of many!"
"I am the fire that cleanses the world!"
"Is that fireproof?"
"Is it hot in here or is it just me?!"
"The inferno begins."
"The fires of vengeance."
"I purify this one!"
"Forged in pain!"
"Their scars will be warning."
"Some say the world will end in fire."
"Burn! Hahaha!"
"Burn! Hahaha!"
"Flames."
"Burning hunger..."
"Some say the world will end in zombies."
"Dead man walking."
"Every day I'm shambling."
"Not easy being green... and dead."
"Wait up!"
"Mmm, flame broiled."
"Quit running, I'm hungry!"
"Blood on my suit."
"This world will be consumed in flames!"
"This is not the end..."
"GG!"
"Every day I'm shuffling"
"You got blood on my suit."
"Promise not to bleed on my suit and I'll kill you quickly."
