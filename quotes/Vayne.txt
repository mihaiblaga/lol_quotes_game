"Nothing's changed since I joined the Sentinels. Well. Better weapons. Maybe."
"As long as they're fighting evil, I'm with the Sentinels. I guess."
"Upgrading to a better class of monster. Feels good. Feels right."
"When we're done here, you wanna help me fight a couple monsters?"
"Gods, if you're gonna lug it around, at least point that thing away from me."
"The Sentinels have given me a higher purpose. Even if I can't do everything I want."
"No greater darkness than the Black Mist... but Viego? He was once a man. We can defeat him."
"I've grown as a person. See a monster? Kill it. But now, sometimes, I wait a second first."
"Surprised at how much I like having the company. Even Graves. Not like I'd tell 'em that."
"The good guys some creatures can be redeemed? We'll see."
"I've gotten too used to the sound my own voice. Now I have to talk... normal."
"I don't need to be the Sentinels' best. I'm already the best."
"Been training for this my whole life. Though I didn't expect the mopey guy with the shadow army."
"Demon hunting can wait while I hold back the Harrowing. Well. Maybe a little demon-hunting on the side."
"Never had tools like this. Guess the Sentinels are good for something."
"You took everything from me, demon. Now I take vengeance."
"Hi, Graves. Don't distract me this time."
"I knew you couldn't be all goodness and light, Gwen."
"Well now, Lucian. Look who's breaking the rules."
"I gave you a chance, Poppy. Should've taken it."
"Senna. Not like you to choose the wrong side."
"You're everything I despise, Viego. A monster, and a disappointment."
"Great. Diana. Watch your back weirdo."
"Only a fool succumbs to power, Draven. And you are a weak fool."
"(sigh) Quit following me around, Graves."
"Come back to our side, Irelia. We'll defeat the evil together."
"Allow me to re-enlighten you, Karma."
"You've chosen darkness, Fortune. There is no pity for your kind."
"I'm your wish come true, Olaf. Let's dance."
"You were human once, Atreus. But now you are my enemy."
"Never trusted you, Pyke. And look who was right."
"Thought you were done being on the wrong side, Riven."
"Your kind shouldn't be allowed to roam Runeterra, Shyvana."
"Tough talk for someone who can't outrun my bolts."
"I don't have time for... humour. That's what that was, right?"
"Next time, choose the right side."
"Evil is as evil does. Poorly."
"One less monster. Worth smiling about."
"My work's not done. It's never done."
"Eh. You deserved it."
"The fate of all who embrace darkness."
"We all have our parts in this fight. Yours was to lose."
"That felt pretty good, demon. So why am I still angry?"
"Good Hustle, Graves. Maybe get some ice for that."
"I don't care how nice you are, Gwen. You're still not human."
"All that fancy training, Lucian, and I'm still a better draw."
"Now who's the best shot, Senna? Hope she didn't hear that."
"What did you expect, Poppy? You've seen my reflexes."
"I'm better than you, Viego. Cry more about it."
"After all this time, I can still knock you down, Graves? Come on."
"Shyvana. Already so monstrous, the corruption barely made a difference."
"Nice shot, Graves. I mean... for you."
"Yes, Graves. You did a great job. Just like last time."
"Think it's time to break out the cee-gars, don't you Graves?"
"They never see their death."
"Monsters never win."
"That's a lot of dead monsters to step over."
"Okay. That one hurt."
"Minor setback. I wont' be stopped."
"I'm not finished with these monsters yet."
"Can't rest until those wraiths are vanquished."
"Where's my gear? There's evil to fight."
