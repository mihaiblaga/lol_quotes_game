"No one fights alone in the Mist."
"Fine. I don't need more enemies."
A stripped-down version of "GIANTS" plays.
"The mist knows my name. It howled it for years, but it was only asking for help."
"Where I'm going, you don't want to go. Seriously, you don't."
"I'm not running from them anymore. They're running from me."
"When there's no more light I'll carry their darkness."
"If I can handle this gun, I can handle myself. Trust me, I can handle this gun."
"Any volunteers to charge blindly into a storm of souls?"
"Come back to life... save the world... all with weapons locked. The sentinels trained me right."
“They've heard my story. Now, they're gonna hear my song.”
“It's the dream that makes us giants. Just gotta dream big enough.”
“Music brings us to life. That's worth fighting for.”
"So, what was it like? All that time in the lantern?"
"A nightmare. Lotta darkness. Food was great though."
"Really?"
*chuckles* "No."
"You're quiet."
"What's to say? You're still cursed."
"Keep that up, and I'll curse you."
"So how's this gonna work?"
"Well, reckon I shoot something twice and then you shoot it a third time."
"Worked so far."
"You been kinda… distant since you came outta that lantern. Somethin' you ain't telling me?"
"Yeah, I met someone in there. He's a ghoul. We fell in love and made ghoul babies."
"Oh. Ha, ha."
"How do you aim that thing? Isn't it heavy?"
"Not if you know what you're doing."
"Cause I tried to… Ohhhhh."
"You ready?"
"I aim to purify."
"Try to keep up."
"Try to be less beautiful."
"I can turn into a screaming cloud."
"Right. I'll keep up."
"Reckon, it's time-"
"-for a reckoning."
"By the time I'm done here, dying will be the easy part."
"It's harder to hold a hand than hold a gun."
"It's always dark on the horizon if you only look up during storms."
"If life is my curse, living is the cure."
"That monster wants to hear me scream… He can keep waiting."
"Living my best life. My best second life."
"Hunted by the forces of darkness? Okay. I can make this work."
"Small talk wasn't really part of my training."
"It's just nice not to be in catacombs."
"Light should teach us not to fear the dark."
"The gun's not heavy after all the fear I've been carrying."
"If something wasn't trying to kill me, it would have me worried."
"Lucian thought I was lost… but I was only changed."
"Fear moves like a current."
"Death doesn't leave scars."
"The mist is not my enemy."
"I'm here to save them all... living and dead."
"The screams of the wraiths are so loud you can't hear your own."
"The only way out of the mist is through it."
"Out of the lantern… hell came with me."
"I remember my nightmares. Wish I could remember to dream."
"I don't carry this to compromise."
"Those trapped in darkness need light the most."
"Fall behind? Follow the screams."
"The past is a wave. Keeps returning."
"I forgive. No one else has to."
"My blood still flows, but I'll never be the same."
"I'll get us through this."
"Sentinel. Wife. A beacon unto damn darkness. When can I just be a person? When can I be me?"
"Too hard, too hurt, too changed. If you're not too much of something then you're not enough you."
"When you're drowning you still remember how to breathe but you can't? That's the mist."
"I'm a long way from the island, but I swear there's still salt in my hair. Might just be dirt from the grave."
"It's enough to hear Lucian say my name."
"The more blood on your hands, the harder it is to let go."
"I used to tell myself I was fighting back… but I was only running with a gun in my hand."
"The grave is silent. You're buried in all the things you never said."
"Part of me keeps wondering when I'll run into the lantern's walls."
"I see myself in them; In the eyes of the people I save, and the darkness reflected there."
"My walls aren't unbreakable. I'm not either."
"Love was left when everything else was torn away."
"No one said this would be easy. If they did, they're probably dead by now."
"Only thing bigger than this gun? The mistake you made standing in its sights."
"If you've got a problem with me, make it two. One for each barrel."
"Don't make this personal. I'm not nice."
"Eternal beauty, Elise? Now that's a curse."
"Another nightmare? Fine. I could use the target practice while I sleep."
"Horsey! What? I can like horses. I can like… things."
"Running shouldn't be part of your plan, Kai'Sa. Survive the fight, not the fear."
"You saved me, Lucian. We saved each other."
"Lucian has a way of breaking down my walls."
"Only a man stubborn enough to fight me would be stubborn enough to love me."
"When we run to the light, shadows are cast behind us. You need to be ready, Lux."
"I know where the ruination began. It flows through us both."
"All this time, Morgana, and you still haven't learned to let go."
"'Darkness?' Welcome to my world."
"When I hear chains I reach for my gun… Wasn't wrong."
"You don't own me, Thresh. I'm not afraid of you."
"Lucian may think you're the enemy. But to me, Thresh? You're only in the way."
"At the center of your lantern there's a soul, wretched and afraid. I think it's you."
"You wanna get my soul? You go through the mist."
"Thresh. You're mine."
"No. We do this together."
"Vayne, you can aim for my heart when you find your own."
"I know where the ruination began. It flows through us both."
"Cats deserve love even if they don't need it… and they use a book to hit you in the face."
"When the mist came to my island, Demacia's gates were closed. Will they be open when you need help?"
"In darkness, we find ourselves."
"Hi, it's me, the one you've been ruthlessly hunting her whole damn life."
"Left one alive. Bad habit…"
"Have I suffered enough yet or do you need me to be a corpse?"
"I could free you, but those you've made suffer come first."
"I know the most ancient, holy ways to kick you in the darkness."
"First rule of being a sentinel."
"Second rule of being a sentinel. Any questions?"
"Am I supposed to say something clever? Some of us have work to do."
"So this is the terror that waddles in the night. Huh."
Senna laughs.
Senna laughs.
Senna laughs.
Senna laughs.
Senna hums.
A muffled beat plays.
"Kill 'em twice just to be sure."
"Death is always in range."
"I don't miss. It's not an option."
"That's enough."
"Gotta whole lotta ugly in my sights."
"All this pain, it's not mine."
"Line up a shot while the whole world screams."
"Keep your distance."
"The gun doesn't have a trigger. I do."
"Darkness and light."
"Wanna kill me? Get in line."
"Stone channels soul."
"Don't go quietly."
"Not my funeral. Already happened."
"I prefer people at gun's length."
"Keep it simple."
"Let's establish some boundaries."
"I feel every shot."
"I can do 'the hard way'."
"If you're here for them, you're here for me."
"I fire my words, like gunlight."
"Don't stand where the gun's pointing."
"Die again? I'll pass."
"I've got your curse."
"Light becomes hope."
"Death is drawn to life."
"Be free…"
"Out of the storm."
"You are mourned."
"Let go."
"Rest now."
"Pain doesn't own you."
"It's not your fault."
"I can bear it."
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
"Life from death."
"Getting used to it."
Thanks."
"I was aiming at them."
"I need you alive to kiss me."
"Could see how that would be preferable."
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
Senna grunts.
"Death remembers."
"One last breath."
"Shadows catch the fallen."
"My enemies. Myself."
"Together."
Senna sighs.
Senna sighs.
"Hearts beat together."
"The song between us."
"Hear the music."
"Lost in the dance."
"Play it loud."
"No shadow without light!"
"No death without life!"
"I've got you!"
"We're running this world!"
"Keep it turning!"
"Eyes wide open!"
"Darkness to darkness. Light to light."
"For the living. For the dead."
"Every death is a sacrifice…"
"If you're only dead, count yourself lucky."
"I've seen too much of this, but I won't close my eyes."
"In death, we fight the same fight." 
"For the light."
"And all lost in darkness."
"Look at us making new memories."
"Same as the old memories."
"Sometimes, I see what the darkness is afraid of."
"You're sweet."
"Lucian… we'll be together again soon."
"We've been through so much, Lucian. Please, don't give up on me now."
"I know what it's like to die, this hurts worse."
"He probably liked that. Creep."
"Handled."
"I won't stop until the nightmares have nightmares."
"Boo."
"Will take more than one wraith to ruin my day."
"Each stone, a sentinel."
"I remember my lessons, and the people who taught them."
"The last blessings of the isles."
"Bound to the stones, bound to each other."
"Next time I sign a contract, I'm checking it for chains."
"Thresh Records only had soul when it had mine."
"I'm breaking free, so the fans can follow."
A beat plays.
"Lucian!"
Senna groans and cries.
Senna groans and cries.
Senna groans.
"Died again? Must be getting good at it."
"Life won't let me go."
"To be reborn… am I still me?"
"Every day I fought for my life. Why should today be any different?"
"Death? Yeah, we're acquainted."
"Everything that's happened… I just want it to matter."
"The angels are gone and the devils are everywhere. I swear, I can't leave y'all alone for ten minutes."
"I was dead. Now I'm not. Ain't that the way o' the west."
"I have been plucked from limbo and delivered into this here gun fight. So, let's gun fight!"
"It's always us, fightin' side by side."
"Saddle up, y'all. We got a showdown on our hands."
"The west has changed. Let's see how much fight it's got in it."
"Ain't good, ain't evil. Big gun though."
"Woulda stayed dead if there weren't more work to do."
"Heaven's gone... for now."
"Whole lotta hell out there."
"The frontier's unpredictable, so am I."
"I'll raise more hell than hell ever dreamed of."
"Mankind's absolution is earned... by the barrel of my gun."
"And hell rode forth? We'll see about that."
"Still getting used to this whole angel thing."
"The west's redemption is in my very capable hands."
"This heart of mine sees the good in everything. Cute."
"Used to hunt monsters. Now...I still hunt monsters."
"What my ressurection lacked in fanfare. It made up in gun horse."
"I can grant folks absolution, the rest is up to them."
"My horse shoots things. Good horse."
"A monumental gun for a monumental task."
"I was reckless and in love. I would not recommend it."
"Shoot first, shoot later, shoot before if you can."
"Why, yes, I am an extremely good shot."
"Something snatched me up before I went to hell. Something old. Something real old."
"Lucian can keep that old pea shooter. Look at the size of my new piece. Look at it!"
"Not sure what happened between bein' dead and bein' alive but at least my gun's bigger."
"Don't know what the west will look like when I'm done with it but it'll be better than this."
"Heaven was destroyed in the blink of an eye. It'll take longer to build it back up again."
"Whatever comes next, it won't be heaven. Or it will. I don't care."
"So my lover's a demon now? Least he keeps things interesting."
"The west runs on conflict as do heaven and hell. There's a lesson in that, I reckon."
"I hope whatever brought me back is happy. Eh, doesn't matter if it's not."
"Angel versus demon. That old chestnut."
"Ashe, I don't want to say you're a counterfeit, but..."
"A deal with the devil, Darius? Where's your gold fiddle?"
"Howdy, Miss."
"Afternoon, Ma'am."
"Now, what the hell are you supposed to be? A bandito? I don't buy it."
"Horsie, huh? Hmph, mine's better."
"Irelia, guess the old angels have seen better days."
"The far west did a number on you, Jhin. Let us commiserate."
"Howdy, friend."
"Afternoon, partner."
"Surprised to see me, Thresh? I ain't surprised to see you."
"You ready for the wrath of heaven restored?"
"I'm still an angel, slick. An angel with a loaded gun."
"You see this gun? Remember this gun."
"I'll give you 'til the count of three. What? I ain't heartless."
"My heart just ain't in this fight. Oh wait...yeah it is."
"Let's hope you're a better shot than a comedian, friend."
"Well, I have a horse. Seems like everybody has a horse... 'cept you."
Senna dances to a beat.
Senna laughs.
"Have a little heart."
"Whoa, now."
"Your sins weigh you down."
"Stand and draw."
"Here comes judgement."
"Heaven can wait."
"Heaven's crucible."
"Necessary work."
"Reckonin' time."
"A scorchin' wind."
"Just doin' my job."
"Saint Doran's fire."
"This'll be over quick."
"Draw."
"Like my gun? I do."
"Can't outrun a gun horse."
"Got you in my sights."
"Giddyup."
"A little shortcut to hell."
"This one's for you."
"Hands high!"
"Deliverance is earned."
"Don't need a holster."
"Dance with me."
"Step right up."
"You seem damned to me."
"A moment of your time."
"Let's walk on 'em."
"Bang."
"You transgressin' little..."
"Hands off, demon. That man is mine."
"I'm ready this time, Thresh."
"Angel fight!"
"Go on, git."
"Heaven's thataway."
"Another one... Mercy!"
"That's right, I saved you."
"Heaven won't be empty for long."
"The west is full up."
"I ain't doin' this for fun, you know."
Effort sounds.
Effort sounds.
Effort sounds.
"Hold that thought."
"You ain't goin' nowhere."
"Stick around."
"Kick up those boots."
"Sit a spell."
"Whoa, partner!"
"Hold up now."
Senna laughs.
Effort sounds.
Effort sounds.
"Heaven and earth."
"Hear the angels."
"Hark."
"I am at hand."
"Deliverance."
"Shrouded in glory."
"Resplendent."
Exhale sound.
Exhale sound.
"JUDGEMENT DAY!"
"YEEEE-HAW!"
"YIPPEE KI-YAY!"
"Stay put, look sharp."
"Bless this thing and whatever it does."
"Let the light shine in."
"A little bit of grace."
"I call it my second sight."
"Look out for trouble."
"Watch over this land. It's a land that needs watchin'."
"A little taste of heaven, a barrel full of hell."
"Feel free to blame everyone but me... and my horse."
"Now, Sentinel, look what you gone and did."
"You made my horse mad, don't do that."
"It was either you or a ressurected angel. Nobody bet on you."
"The west is won, again, by me! You're all welcome."
"Good fight, Lucian. Can't wait to do this every night for the rest of forever."
"Don't put your trust in the devil, Darius. The devil lies."
"Can anyone just have that sombrero? I'm takin' it."
"Neigh, Hecarim. Neigh."
"I don't know where you'll end up, Irelia, but I'm sure it's boring."
"Great talk, Jhin. Come back a little less weird next time."
"Now that's the difference between a half horse and a full horse."
"You can keep my heart, Thresh. I picked up a better one."
"I didn't go to hell then and I ain't goin' now. Sentinel, hah!"
"I say when this is over, and no one else! Sentinel, let's ride!"
"Y'all can fight amongst yourselves! Come on, Sentinel. Yeehaw!"
"Aw... not again..."
"Lucian..."
"Aw, shucks..."
Death sounds.
Death sounds.
"I'll keep coming back 'til the good work is done."
"Wonders never cease, and neither do I."
"Can't keep a good angel down."
