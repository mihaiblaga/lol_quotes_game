"Blood runs... they all run."
"They fear me. They should."
"The blood you spilled calls to me."
"The chains are broken... the beast is free."
"Oh, what a day. What a bloody day."
"Violence  super charged!"
"Blood and chrome!"
"The beast grows stronger."
"This place is familiar."
"Run... while you can."
"I am in control."
"Zaun will watch you bleed, and it will do nothing."
"I can smell everything."
"Vengeance is only a step behind you."
"You know what you've done."
"You made the monster."
"The city is my hunting ground."
"Try to hide."
"All the blood you've spilled brought me here."
"I know Zaun's streets like the back of my claws."
"I became the monster I always was."
"The memories come back every time you scream."
"Zaun will fight back!"
"The man I was... I killed him first."
"Run faster!"
"Can't save you all... don't want to."
"Killing... remember!"
"Blood's on me!"
"Give in... the beast!"
"No screams!"
"Pain... nothing!"
"Watch you bleed!"
"Claws... hungry!"
"Hero...  die !"
"Men... slaughter... "
"Hurting you... "
"I ran these streets - now it's your turn to run."
"Violence can be death - or a way of life."
"Nine tails to chase!"
"Zaun has enough shadows."
"There's more to kill in a plague rat. You're all machine."
"So deep in Piltover's pockets, I can only see your hat."
"I'll pick my teeth with your legs!"
"Blood, hextech and... (sniffs) tea."
"Progress is just what Piltovans call murder."
"I'll show you pain!"
"Rewind too far, and you'll be back in my teeth!"
"The one person in Zaun who runs to the past."
"You were there... "
"Let me forget... "
"Which one of you is the wolf?"
"From a roar to a scream!"
"You can't even kill an insect."
"Eat your heart out."
"You're going to need more bandages!"
"Can't outrun your mistakes!"
"I remember what you did!"
"Zaun gave me claws long before you did."
"There are more rats than men in Zaun."
"And I thought the chem-barons were vermin."
"Which one of us is the monster?"
"The fear in your eyes. I've seen it before."
"Zaun needed you!"
"Who taught you how to punch?"
"Three arms and no claws."
"Yordles. The alpha predator."
"First I'll kill you, and then I'll--- yordle!"
"I don't know what you are, but I hope you bleed!"
"Zaun has enough shadows."
"Who's a good boy? I am!"
"Scratch behind my ears... "
"I'll do a trick for a Warwick snack!"
"You're the prey!"
"Less talking, more biting!"
"Blood brings rage."
"Like men to the slaughter."
"It takes a monster to gut one."
"If you die, how many live?"
"Killing, I remember."
"You die next."
"A monster's inside you... I'll tear it out!"
"This pain is nothing."
"Not even your screams will escape."
"Heroes always die!"
"It's not the beast you should be afraid of."
"The killing stops when Zaun is free."
"Bones to break."
"Give in to the beast."
"This is who I am."
"You'll answer to me."
"Blood is the price."
"You hurt them, I hurt you."
"You'll choke on your screams."
"In... control...!"
"I became... monster!"
"What have you done?!"
"Fear me!"
"Can't... save you...!"
"Broken...!"
"All... is anger!"
"Seeking... hunting... "
"Try... hide!"
"Bite back!"
"Run, faster!"
"Blood spilled!"
"Rev up! Drums play. Drums play. Drums play. Drums play. Drums play. "Meat!"
"I have your scent."
"More scars - as if I didn't have enough."
"If I don't kill you, Zaun will."
"Back to killing  chem-barons ."
"You killed Warwick, but left the beast."
"I almost felt that."
"One thing you should know; I honour my debts."
"I can smell your fear!"
"I'll eat your heart, Starchild."
"GG!"
"Time to run!"
"I'll eat your heart, Starchild."
"Heroes Never Die!"
