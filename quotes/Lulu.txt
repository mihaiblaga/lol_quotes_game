"Pleased to meet you!"
"I recommend skipping."
"Burning Bright" plays. "I recommend skipping."
"Just a pinch!"
"Yup, that tasted purple."
"You'll see more with your eyes closed."
"Whoa... dizzy."
"Nosey dewdrop... "
"Never look a tulip in the eye..."
"That squirrel looks familiar."
"C'mon you, let's dance! Ha!"
"Let's go around again! Ha!"
"I could go for a twirl... Whoa, whoa whoa ah, wooh!"
"Let's put on our thinking caps! Hmm... hmmhmm, hmmhmm... ah, I got it!"
"They aren't gonna like this."
"Dust em, Pix!"
"A solid giggle should do the trick."
"Let's use  all  the colors!"
"Too tall... much too tall."
"Fix!"
"Zippy!"
"Vroom vroom!"
"Tut tut!"
"Hot foot!"
"Adoribus!"
"Fuzzy!"
"Delightify!"
"Transmogulate!"
"Cuddly incoming!"
"Hugify!"
"Tremendo!"
"Up we go!"
"Enormibus!"
"Burning Bright" plays. Lulu groans. Lulu groans. Lulu groans. Lulu groans. "Did everything just taste purple for a second?"
"Po oczach ich,    Pix , po oczach!"
"Go for the eyes, Pix, for the eyes!"
