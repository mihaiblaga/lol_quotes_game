"Fear not… I will make use of your corpse."
"It's your funeral."
"I once had honor before the Ruination."
"This land will never heal. But I will lay it to rest."
"Tired, ancient, and half-dead. Still, I come for you."
"I am the rift between life and death. The thin divide between breath and grave."
"Yorick, look what you've become."
"I've become what I must be."
"Let us in, remove your chains."
"I think not."
"Your human form is so confining. You could be infinite."
"I am enough."
"There is no hope."
"There is some."
"We see you, Yorick. We know your weakness."
"You know nothing."
"Join us in eternity, Yorick."
"In the beyond, once you're free."
"What I do is just. Every horrid piece of it."
"The Mist writhes, searching for a place to take root."
"Death is not to be feared."
"We're dead much longer than we are alive."
"What hell is worse than this limbo?"
"Everyone I knew is dead. How are things with you?"
"They once called these isles undying. Yet die, they will."
"How quick the turn from blessed to cursed."
"These isles… how they scream."
"Soon, this depravity will end."
"The beyond is waiting. Strive to meet it."
"I am no tyrant. These souls act on their own."
"This mist has become skin."
"The isles were once paradise; now they're a prison."
"I go wherever souls are adrift."
"The constant wailing of souls in torment."
"I cling to life by the thinnest thread."
"If they could see what I see, they'd long for death."
"But for the waters, the mist would take me."
"The Ruined King will soon meet the victims of his curse."
"From the ground they come, and to it, they return."
"Ours is a fate worse than death."
"I carry these souls to their end… wherever it may be."
"Water for the living, shovel for the dead."
"Our souls are a small price to pay to cleanse this land."
"I am the first and last of my order."
"My curse is our only hope."
"I remember when I put them 
in
 the ground."
"So many souls, so few bodies."
"To most, life is fleeting; to me, it is quagmire."
"Death is not always a release."
"Death used to mean something."
"Tell me of the beyond… in case I never make it."
"Tears of life preserve me."
"The Ruined King's allies shall fall with him."
"One can stare into the grave too long."
"This journey is long, but I will complete it."
"I do not live in hope. I work to return it."
"It hurts to remember."
"Do you hear that? It is the end."
"The dead have not forgotten."
"Hallowed or profane… I no longer know."
"All things fade… but me."
"It is to the grave, we go."
"What a beautiful dream is life."
"Remember my name. For one day, I will not."
"I do not know what lies beyond. But it is better than this."
"The dead don't hear you, no matter how you cry."
"The dead shall forgive me. I hope."
"We shall prevail. We have eternity."
"Life is but a brief disinterment."
"You'll make a fine addition to my cloak."
"For you, I won't dig too deep."
"I pity what you have become. Shall I end your suffering?"
"I have nothing but time. Show me something else."
"Yours is an easy grave to dig, small one."
"They say I was once your age, though I can't quite recall."
"Your corpses against mine. May the best win."
"Those you ride down will soon rise against you."
"You and I share a common goal. The similarities end there."
"Enjoy this limbo while you can, for I will soon end it."
"I know you. And I see you always."
"One day, you will take me. May it be soon."
"No, Lucian, I haven't seen your wife."
"You remind me that the world is sometimes good - and very naive."
"I fight to free you as well - though a hatchet would suffice."
"My army will soon storm your gates, revenant."
"Your's is a fool's errand. The world must be allowed to die."
"You think you want immortality. I'll gladly give you mine."
"Those souls are not yours to keep."
"I've endured more pain than any words can bring."
"I no longer feel insults."
"I'm just happy to have company."
"Ah yes, I remember spewing idle words."
"Ah, missed it. There it goes! Where is it at? - ah! Yes!"
"Ah, would you like some friends? Nope, can't have 'em."
"I suppose I have eternity to think about that one."
Yorick laughs.
Yorick laughs.
Yorick laughs.
"Ah yes, I remember what laughter sounds like."
Yorick plays a bass tune.
Yorick plays a bass tune.
“The hole I dig, it is for you.”
“So many souls to liberate."
"To death."
"The beyond awaits you."
"To dirt, you return."
"I'll mourn for you."
"Respects to the dying."
"Scatter their remains."
"You are beyond saving."
"The mist comes for you."
"Your tomb awaits."
"You decay and do not know it."
"You are to die."
"You will rot."
"I will not damn you. I will end you."
"Your end is nigh."
"No eulogy for you."
"Prepare your epitaph."
"I am to bury you."
"Die to rise again."
"The grave is your home."
"Flesh that will soon find earth."
"The isles remember!"
"I must dig!"
"What's one more grave?!"
"I shall perform your rites!"
"Your kind is supposed to live long. I am sorry."
"I need your essence, great beast."
"That is a lot of flesh to raise."
"Even your kind will join the mist."
"Yours will be the largest coffin."
"Kill, and use its form."
"Rest in your rightful place."
"Return, and fight."
"This horde consumes all."
"A little longer, friend, then rest."
"Join me, brother."
"Some of these faces I know well."
"Arise and return to this world."
"They rise, they fight, they rot."
"Wake up. You have a new task."
"Die with me brothers, and be free."
"Walk once more."
"I thank you for your service."
"Welcome back, you won't be here long."
"It's good to see you."
"Allies from below."
"Hello, friends."
"Ah yes, I remember you."
"Won't you join them?"
"The damned resist their fate."
"The ruins of these isles rise to smite you."
"This never ends."
"To destroy the curse, I use it."
"Take shape."
"An eternal ring."
"It's you they seek."
"They reach for you."
"Watch them squirm."
"An unholy mark upon you."
"A curse upon the ground."
"A profane sacrament."
"It fouls upon touch."
"Feel its pull."
"It claims you."
"Behold the horrors of the isles!"
"Go, take what you will."
"See the Maiden? She comes for 
you
."
"Submit. Surrender."
"Do not resist."
"All will join."
"The mist takes all!"
"We devour it. It becomes us!"
"We are not corruption. We are strength!"
"More, more for the black maw of the mist!"
"One more step toward domination!"
"One more step toward the end."
"We are stronger. We shall take all!"
"Do you feel it? I am 
more
!"
"We feed, we grow!"
Yorick's theme starts playing.
A tune plays.
"Another voice in the cacophony of wails."
"Flesh torn asunder, flesh reborn."
"We all end the same."
"Look at the wrong you do!"
"It is necessary."
"Your remains will serve a purpose."
"One more nail in the coffin of the isles."
"I can't bury them all."
"My army grows."
"All these bodies going to waste."
"My graveyard is full."
"All things decay."
"Mortar crumbles."
"Everything that stands must fall."
"Forward, we press."
"It falls, like all things."
"Makes its own tomb."
"Don't bury me with it. You can't take it with you."
"Even a monk needs bread and water."
"Material items, for the material world."
"The sword of a great man."
"The sword of a fool."
"The king will return for it."
"Then I will strike him down."
"The blade of the father."
"A tyrant who will pay for his crimes."
"This blade has performed great feats."
"And I will use it to undo them."
"I wouldn't be caught dead in that."
"Mere rags, soon to fade."
"A sack to cover flesh and bone."
"The armor of someone soon to die."
"It fits me to perfection."
"Taken from one who can no longer use it."
"The dead need no armor, but I do."
"Too valuable to bury."
"As cold as the hand of death."
"Cold, even to my touch."
"To slow the fleet of foot."
"It pulses with life, as the isles once did."
"Red is the heart that barely beats in me."
"A vital ornament."
"A gauntlet to throw before the king."
"They'll find me hard to bury."
"Gives life when death is near."
"A ghastly armament."
"A gift from kind specters."
"Sometimes the dead can give life."
"Stay with me, spirit."
"The only warmth I've found."
"To cremate my foes."
"The fire of life burns within."
"To delay the end."
"To life."
"I still draw breath."
"Even a monk needs respite."
"We all return to our origin."
"A breath between rites."
"My path is a circle, my work never-ending."
"You retreat like a coward."
"I will return anon."
"The bells toll and I respond."
"Do not grieve."
"I grow cold."
"At last."
"I see the 
 wolf."
"The shock of resurrection quickly passes."
"I've come too far to stay dead."
"We do not die, and so we fight on."
"When we end, we begin again."
"Revived by the tears of life."
"One day, I will no longer awaken."
"A fleeting repose."
"A futile act, why do you persist?"
"Because I must."
"The beyond is not given. It is earned."
"Our time has not yet come."
"There will be no requiem. Not yet."
"We shall rise to this challenge."
"GG!"
"Victory… slips away."
"Throw down the gauntlet"
