"One to cut, one to seal."
"You think  I  am the one to fear? Hmph."
"Before, I chased a wayward gale. Now I hunt a storm of darkness."
"Many mistake me for the nightmares I slay. Hmph, let them."
"In this cursed second life, where does the mask end, and I begin?"
"They look at me and see only the mask."
"The azakana have spread like a plague since the Noxian invasion. My work... never ends."
"Haunted by a past I cannot change."
"A festival of flowers to remember those lost... I think I'd rather be forgotten."
"In life, we died at each other's hands. How can I bear to face my brother now?"
"Azakana lurk everywhere. I will end their depredations."
"Some days I forget what lies behind this mask."
"Sleep is not for the weak, but for the blessed."
"Demons take many forms, I hunt them all the same."
"The spirit realm is... strange. A mirror, an inverse, of our own."
"I do not hunt to kill."
"No fate, nor destiny. Only tomorrow."
"Now, there is only the hunt."
"Sometimes, to save someone, you must fight  them."
"I'm not here to save their souls."
"Honor once bound me above all else."
"Fear, once named, controls no one."
"The road to ruin, I've walked it once before."
"I do what must be done."
"What does one do with an abundance of masks?"
"Forgiveness is... complicated."
"The hunt... it never ends."
"Without a banquet of sorrow, an azakana starves."
"No sleep, no rest... there is no time."
"Rare is the person who shows their true face."
"The haunted cower behind polite fictions."
"Azakana abound."
"Between uncertainty and fear, the azakana prowl."
"Walk both realms."
"Forget the past, it only clouds the future."
"Humans lie, swords... speak truth."
"Wear a mask long enough, and you forget the face beneath."
"On a cliff by the sea, I found the strangest spirit. It walked on four legs and spoke of dreams."
"A broken heart, an anxious mind, all can attract the azakana."
"Azakana trap their victims in an vicious cycle of emotion. Doubt breeds doubt, fear breeds fear, and the azakana feasts."
"Long before blades and sorcery are needed, words... can save a soul."
"So many try to flee their burdens. Fleeing is impossible!"
"Bound to the world of the living. (sighs) Denied the peace of death..."
"Every aspect of an azakana is a stroke. Each stroke forms a character, revealing their true name..."
"One blade carries the weight of my past. The other, holds the key to my future..."
"When we met in the spirit realm, this azakana upon my face knew me!"
"Through the mask, I see their truths laid bare. Yet my own - (scoffs) - dance just out of reach..."
"I will take no joy in cutting you down!"
"Blink, and you'll miss your own death!"
"Two paths cross. One, condemned to end."
"Ah, to be blind to the true dangers of this world!"
"A walking  feast  for azakana!"
"Such bravado! But you're fooling no one."
"I know your name."
"Death rejected me, but I'm sure it will welcome you!"
"Perhaps you can charm some sense into my foolish brother, Ahri."
"Evelynn.  A sugary mask for such a master of agony."
"What ancient horror is this?  Is... is this what an azakana could become?!"
"I have fallen outside your cycle, Lamb and Wolf. Are you here to usher me back?"
"Kled... who hurt you?"
"A comfort to see you, Lillia, after so many azakana..."
"Do not wish to hide behind masks, Lillia. Yours... is a kind face."
"Living nightmare! I will end you before you cross paths with the dream fawn!"
"Guilt clings to you, Riven. Forgive yourself, or the azakana  will  find you."
"Balance is a delusion, Shen. Surely you see that now."
"Grafted to a demon by choice?  What a grand fool!"
"Tahm Kench.  Twocoats.  I know your true name, demon!"
"Taliyah, the one you call master is a fool!"
"Is that the taste of salt on the wind?  Ah... hello, brother."
"A broken mask meets a dishonored blade."
"Brother, our paths cross once again. Will our swords do the same?"
"An innocent spirit! I'd... almost forgotten those existed!"
"Unhaunted, unworthy of my time!"
"Azakana, once named... can be bound."
"Ah, eating. How I miss it."
"Heh."
"Hmph."
"Heh."
"Kindness is a luxury!"
"This is your remedy!"
"Out of my way!"
"I will save you from yourself!"
"Relent!"
"Weighed down by fear!"
"Bound by your insecurities!"
"They always resist redemption!"
"It's too late for you!"
"Your doubt betrays you!"
"You can't flee your fears!"
"You force my hand!"
"Such a burdened soul!"
"Unworthy of my blades!"
"Regrets hold you back!"
"I'm not here for you!"
"Inner demons, hmph."
"No time for sympathy!"
"Aren't you a haunted one?"
"Carve away doubt!"
"Relinquish your burdens!"
"Strike true!"
"Yield, or fall to my blades!"
"Your fight is with yourself!"
"What must be done!"
"Steel and spirit!"
"I am not the enemy."
"Everyone wears masks!"
"Piercing winds!"
"Storm of blades!"
"Steel gale!"
"O'sai!"
"Kuo'an!"
"Kase'ton!"
"Carve the spirit!"
"Cut through lies!"
"Severed!"
"Cast out!"
"Nowhere to hide!"
"Spirit unmoored!"
"Cross the veil!"
"Begone."
"Excised."
"Farewell."
"My blades know your name!"
"Let's end this!"
"Nothing personal!"
"Blades blossom!"
"Demons begone!"
"Spirits unleashed!"
"If only you'd listened!"
"Too far gone."
"May your spirit find the peace you did not."
"Another azakana, sealed."
"Their fates, sealed by my hand!"
"A respite, to return the sealed to their rightful place."
"The more I seal away... the more they seem to multiply!"
"With each mask I claim, I come one step closer to understanding my own."
"Another... failure..."
"Urgh... it... consumes me..."
"No respite! No release..."
"A familiar... embrace..."
"Defeated? (grunts) Hardly!"
"Now... it's a little personal."
"When will I know peace?"
"I thought death would grant me peace... how na√Øve."
"Not enough to stop me."
"Every time it's no less strange... nor less painful."
"...back to the hunt."
"The gods' end, the world's fall... I can save us. I will save us."
"I stand alone between creation and eternal war. Demonic and divine."
"Dawn knows no mercy. Dusk knows no restraint."
"A path of only light or darkness is a path to ruin."
"Hide now, brother, but at world's end, where will you run?"
"Prophecy means nothing to a determined soul."
"The gods have forgotten fear, compassion, reason."
"There is evil in willful ignorance."
"They all seek my aid, but do they listen? No."
"Tyranny lies in both order and chaos."
"Peace is worth all of this and more."
"All my kin are flawed- the mortal, and the godly."
"My hand may stem the tides of war."
"Is violence truly the only language gods understand?"
"No second chances. It is peace or apocalypse."
"Mortality is a gift. The promise of change."
"War is the prelude to our end."
"Mortals are never absolute. That is their beauty."
"Introspection is a luxury I cannot afford."
"Death cannot be our destiny."
"(sighs) The hubris of gods and men."
"If peace demands sacrifice, then sacrifice I will."
"Must I be my only ally?"
"Mortal hearts seek peace. Divine forms deliver justice."
"Daylight or darkness, my course remains the same."
"A few lives taken, generations saved."
"The gods, the world, the future..."
"I may grow weary, but I will not stop."
"Chaos and order are my weapons to wield."
"Somehow, I must make them listen."
"War is not chaos, it is not order. It is oblivion."
"Chaos without peace is torment. Order without end is stagnation."
"Stop Morgana. Find my brother. Bend the course of fate itself."
"Soraka's prophecy is a chain, binding us to oblivion. I will break us free."
"Order and chaos, dawn and dusk... I am neither. I am both."
"Gods scheme, bicker, rage... yet mortals are the ones who suffer."
"What lies beyond the horizon of dawn and dusk? A future unwritten."
"Mortality sets me apart from my kin... but it may be their saving grace."
"A fiend and an archoness... working together?"
"Squabbling man. What do you know of godhood?"
"You call yourself 'god-king.' King of what? God of whom?"
"You can embrace darkness and light, Kayn. You need not choose."
"Nightmares will not deter me, demon fawn."
"Good intentions may doom us all, Morgana."
"You met your fate once, Riven. A shame to repeat it."
"Sister, we can avert your prophecy. We can change!"
"Armies break upon your blade, Tryndamere. I will not."
"Brother, is that you?  (scoffs)  No. No stench of brimstone."
"Aeons, brother. I have finally found you. Now, you will listen."
"Stay your sermons. I won't be swayed."
"Do not waste breath tempting me to darkness."
"Attack, if you like. Swords are unnecessary for swatting flies."
"Not worth my scorn."
"The end of days is upon us, and you jest?"
"You seek destruction?"
"Spare yourself and run!"
"Do not test me."
"I will not fail."
"I am the final hope!"
"So ignorant!"
"Your resolve against mine!"
"I will not bend!"
"Lament."
"Fate falls to me!"
"At your peril!"
"My wrath!"
"Witness!"
"Prophecy be damned!"
"You court death."
"It is not too late!"
"By light or darkness!"
"For creation!"
"By my blade!"
"I do not hesitate!"
"Too late for regret!"
"Infernal dawn!"
"Flee while you can!"
"Stand corrected!"
"Suffer your fate!"
"Relent!"
"Succumb!"
"Deliverance!"
"Retribution!"
"Enough!"
"Blessed dusk!"
"Sever fate!"
"No time for mercy!"
"Behold!"
"Power awakened!"
"Divinity unbound!"
"I am your reckoning!"
"I ascend!"
"Dawn and dusk as one!"
"Your final breath!"
"War ends now."
"One less for the war."
"Your death for a better world."
"The cost of peace."
"Equivalent exchange."
"How many more lives must I take?"
"I pity your ignorance."
"When will you learn?"
"Where was your reason? Your compassion?"
"Death is a kindness."
"You stood in my way."
"Your road ends here. Mine stretches onward."
"What fools these mortals be."
"Aphelios, Alune... true hearts, but misguided."
"You are no cousin of mine, 'god-king.'"
"What is a 'god-king' to a true god?"
"You could have been so much more, Kayn."
"Nightmares must end, Lillia."
"Morgana... I asked for peace. You gave me none."
"Rest now, Riven. No tyranny of dawn remains."
"You were the only one who understood, Soraka."
"War finds peace."
"Rest now, brother. Chaos reigns no more."
"Dawn has met its dusk."
"Darkness laid to rest."
"Destiny's price, paid in blood!"
"I need rest. Perhaps it is the mortal in me."
"Not retreat, preparation. I will be ready for anything."
"I step back only to move forward."
"Still mortal... after all..."
"Was this fate's design...?"
"I am not so mortal. I will not fall as humans do."
"My brother, the gods, they must listen to reason... they must."
"My war against war is not yet through."
"Death can wait. Destiny cannot."
"Sleep is not for the weak, but for the blessed."
"Sleep is for the guiltless."
"The road to ruin, I've walked it once before."
"The road to ruin is shorter than you think."
"Kindness is a luxury! "Virtue is no more than a luxury. "Forget the past, it only clouds the future."
"Hmph. One step ahead of the past. "On a cliff by the sea I found the strangest spirit. It walked on four legs and spoke of dreams."
"I met the strangest human in my forest. D-Do you think they're here? I still have their dream."
"Nothing personal!"
