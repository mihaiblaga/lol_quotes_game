"It is my burden to carry an eye of god. It is my privilege to see the truth."
"We cannot comprehend the design. A raindrop cannot comprehend a river valley."
"To die is to drown - so I will swim well, till I can swim no more."
"If I hate something, I destroy it. If I want something, I take it."
"We are born knowing what to do. We must only act."
"They must be tested to grow."
"It is terrible to be satisfied. The world needs us to chase dreams."
"This ends one of two ways - they run, or I break them."
"I don't scare, I don't tire, and I don't stop."
"Good? Evil? Why should we care for such things?"
"Life is the sweetness of fruit, and the joy of battle!"
"There is joy in food... and fighting."
"Motion is all."
"The sea is ripe for battle."
"I break hearts. I break spines."
"Ah, everyone has a plan, until they get punched in the face."
"Men live, men die. Change is good."
"They will learn or they will die."
"There are kind and gentle gods. Mine isn't one of those."
"The ocean is calm. It is our desires that stir it."
"Even if I die, I die in motion."
"The waves will drag you down, unless you fight to shore."
"How could I love only one man? They break too easily."
"All of us are born storms."
"Wisdom is frequently a kick in the head."
"Life is too short for fear."
"Chase what is desired."
"We are not one soul. We are many."
"Many gods ask for worship. They are weak gods."
"My god is not love - it is a kick in the pants."
"Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens."
"Many die. Worthy souls find new forms."
"Bearded Lady, Nagakabouros, names don't matter! Action does."
"It is the storm that is life."
"I value truth - and barbecue."
"My name is Illaoi."
"My god doesn't want peace."
"All that lives... moves."
"Live your life, chase what you desire, what else matters?"
"A fool and his spirit are easily parted."
"Watch your mouth, or I'll slap the soul out of you."
"Fight me, if you have the spirit."
"I want you to hit me as hard as you can."
"Smile, child, or I'll shove your jaw into your brain."
"You wanted to be a god! Instead, you are a useless antique!"
"Foul creature, you would stop time when all things must move!"
"You soul is a fetid, stagnant pool, untouched by the tide!"
"You are not free from death! You 
are
 dead."
"Your powers are stolen from the flow. You have damned your homeland."
"Abomination! You are without motion."
"You suffered... but learned nothing."
"What is truly noble and good would never ask you to serve another!"
"Duty, honor, nations? These are stagnant falsehoods!"
"You are slaves enchained by lies when we were born to chase our desires!"
"Laws, rules, these are falsehoods! Truth is chaos!"
"Your people pretend to be strong. I think they are afraid."
"Your people seek a worthy death. Mine, a worthy life."
"You are a cycle without purpose. I will end you!"
"Fiend, I bring you true death."
"You are a cloud of broken souls, you are an abomination."
"You will trouble this land no more."
"You are not welcome here, creature."
"I am your enemy because you offend my god - because you cannot change."
"You will challenge me? Ha ha ha ha... even death fears my god."
"Why would I need a spirit's help? I am guided by Nagakabouros."
"Little one, I don't need empathy. Seek those who do."
"Go back to where men are weak, and need your inspiration."
"We know your true name. We do not fear you."
"Life is not balance. It is motion!"
"Foolish spirit, begone!"
"You, I like."
"Foolish spirit, begone!"
"Northman. There are motions I would like to show you."
"I know you are strong. I wonder if you have stamina."
"Finally, a man who won't break."
"You live as Nagakabouros intends. Good."
"You move well. Now, you must only find joy in the motion."
"Your god was forgotten. Mine cannot be ignored."
"False prophet! You don't even serve a true god!"
"I do not challenge you, I bring you the test!"
"I broke men's hearts. I broke men's spines. You're the first who's going to get both."
"You paid your tithe to the mother. Now show me what she taught you."
"You have learned your lesson, now fight! Kill! Conquer!"
"You are in motion, love."
"I do not want excuses. The failure was yours."
"Did she not show you the way forward? Go!"
"You want revenge? Take it!"
"You swim well, Gangplank."
"Honor? Duty? Ha! What your heart demands is all that matters."
"You live as Nagakabouros intends. Good."
"You have followed our ways as if born to them."
"Gangplank will find you."
"You live as Nagakabouros intends. Good."
"The tempest is Nagakabouros. You serve, but are blind."
"I do not challenge you, I bring you the test!"
"You, I like."
"Trust the motion. All spirits are Nagakabouros'."
"No love is impossible, my god demands you follow your desires."
"Foolish spirit, begone!"
"You worship the sun - it is my god that drives it through the sky."
"Your faith asks for obedience - it is weak."
"Your god offers light without wisdom."
"Gangplank will find you."
"It is you who have shown Gangplank his path. For that, I thank you."
"Gangplank was drowning. Your actions reminded him to swim."
"You are in motion - but only as a parasite on a host."
"Ugly thing. You weren't designed by god, you were made by fools."
"Creature, you move - but are useless."
"You are a foul creation - born from ignorance."
"What kind of stupid god made you?"
"You, I like."
"They have cheated you of rebirth."
"You move only from hunger that consumes itself."
"Creature, why would I listen to lies when I can see the truth?"
"Your fine words don't disguise your foul design."
"Aw, child, you are cute, but I doubt you will be for long."
"Gangplank will find you."
"You, I like."
"Change, or feel my god's wrath."

"You are not in motion."
"This will be quick."
"To live... is to fight."
"You 
will
 be tested."
"We never stop."
"This is a great day."
"Reality is brutal."
"Blessed is motion."
"I am here to test souls."
"Ha! Let's begin again!"
"A good fight."
"Now... we begin."
"This is the first lesson."
"The vortex is all."
"Ha ha ha, you think you can beat me?"
"They need wisdom. They don't need teeth."
"You stagnated."
"You will be destroyed."
"I slayed greater serpents as a child."
"Here they call you a monster. In Buhru, we would call you dinner."
"Move!"
"Now!"
"Learn!"

"Behold."
"Nagakabouros surrounds us."
"The truth is all around you."
"This is the motion. All is Nagakabouros."
"I do not walk alone. I am with my god. It is here."
"You cannot hide from god. You cannot hide from the test."
"Live your journey - or die in mine."
"Your spirit is held - take it if you can."
"What you desire, you must take."
"You speak of having a soul. It was never yours. None of them were."
"Fear is good. Use it."
"Change, or you will be pulled down."
"Our mother demands your tithe."
"You are drowning - I want you to swim."
"Your soul drowns. Fight."
"Take back your spirit."
"Each of your lives has served the vortex."
"Death is only one outcome."
"We learn from action. Move, or die."
"This... is... the test."
"This will be a good day - if you live."
"Drive forward - it is destiny that calls you."
"Love, fight, live."
"Seize today, and you've earned tomorrow."
"Fight and die with purpose."
"My god doesn't want you to kneel. It wants you to fight."
"You have been given the tools to know your destiny."
"The failure of your lives is written on your soul."
"Now... do you see the truth?"
"We are all free. Seeing the truth only reminds us."
"Each moment is earned."
"All of us are lost, all of us are blind. You must swim towards your destiny."
"Countless lifetimes lead our bodies foward, and drive our spirits towards their true destiny."
"I don't want you to fail, I want you to learn."
"Child, you must earn your soul. Prove yourself."
"The battle is lost only when you surrender. Fight for your soul."
"You are the tinest sliver of energy held briefly in shape. Where this energy flows is your destiny."
"This moment is waiting to be seized."
"Every day is waiting to be taken."
"I don't want you to worship. I want you to learn."
"I will break you if that's what it takes."
"Give up, and your life is nothing."
"Each lifetime is a spirit. Each lifetime is a chance. Take it."
"Not bad! At least you're moving."
"Perhaps you're not hopeless after all."
"Yes, you are learning."
"This is how you learn."
"Don't stop!"
"Good, this is the lesson."
"Do not tire, do not slow, push onward."
"Exactly. If you want your soul, take it."
"Keep going, keep striving. This is our way."
"Again. Push onward."
"Ha! Well done."
"Better."
"Your souls wait for you. Take them back if you can."
"This is the way of Nagakabouros - motion!"
"Finally, now you are in motion."
"To challenge, to fight... this pleases Nagakabouros."
"You have learned the first lesson."
"Pray I don't have to teach you again."
"Nagakabouros accepts your tithe."
"You swim well."
"Learn well, or you will be tested again."
"You are in motion."
"You have been tested. You have done well."
"Don't make me test you again."
"Did you blunder into victory, or did you learn?"

"Behold!"
"Kebouros!"
"Shai!"
"The truth!"
"Naga-sho!"
"Altak!"
"This is motion!!"
"All is Nagakabouros!!"
"All is motion!!"
"You cannot hide!"
"Tentakill!"
"It is not what we have, it is what we can throw away."
"Things should be held only when we need them."
"Only what moves, only what lives... has value."
"When I am done with this... it will make a fine offering."
"I like this. I should buy everyone one of these."
"I am going to walk all over them."
"My god is motion, but speed is useful."
"This fits me better than Gangplank."
"All on Buhru take this test - I passed it long ago."
"Who is Randuin? Was she a priestess?"
"Sterak? It is the fury of the 
mother
 I will bring."
"The Kraken. The Serpent. The Hydra. A god's appearance is limited only by those observing it."
"It is my god that protects me - but these metal clothes are nice."
"Nagakabouros, uki, uki."
