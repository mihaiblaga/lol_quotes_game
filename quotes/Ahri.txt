"Don't you trust me?"
"Playtime's over."
"Shall we?"
"Indulge me."
"How tempting."
"Don't hold back."
"Tell me a secret."
"Don't you trust me?"
"I know what they desire."
"Should I make your pulse rise? Or... stop!" *Giggles*
"If you'd like to play with me, you'd better be sure you know the game."
"Come try your luck, if you think you're in my league." *Giggles*
"Playtime's over."
"They're mine now."
"It's too late for mercy."
"Let's have some real fun."
"No one will stand in my way."
"They've exhausted their use."
"POP/STARS". Ahri groans. Ahri groans. Ahri groans. Ahri groans. A stripped-down version of "A New Horizon" plays, which then switches to "Burning Bright". "Come on Kiko, we're the life of the party."
"The First Star doesn't control my destiny! I do."
"The darkest night makes for the brightest stars!"
"I don't want to think about the past. Or the future."
"Falling in love. That's how a star falls."
"A guardian gives everything they've got!"
"Put your game face on, girls."
"Star guardians are in it to win it."
"Let's show'em what we're made of! Starlight!"
"Starlight binds us."
"Fight for each other! Nothing else matters."
"A world without my sisters isn't worth saving."
"Time to Supernova!"
"The frenemy of my enemy is my... friend? Ugh, something like that."
"Right! They're all going to be cosmic dust!"
"Have you ever been in love, Kiko?"
"Aww... That's sweet."
"Winning first Kiko.... then ice cream sundaes!"
"Kiko! Such language."
"Of course they look up to me. Half the time I'm flying."
"Time to save the world!"
"Let's light up the sky!"
"Change is coming!"
"Heavenly body coming through!"
"I'm playing on nothing but heart!"
"No one controls me!"
"I don't accept destiny... I defy it!"
"Starshine makes everything better!"
"I can't help it if I'm a natural leader."
"This star follows her own path!"
"It can be a burden to shine so bright!"
"Starlight is my spotlight!"
"All I get is attention!... I was hoping for obsession."
*Giggles* "Tails don't lie!"
"Who's afraid of a little fighting?... I've survived gym class."
"Loving too deeply. That's how a star falls."
"I'm always chasing the moment!"
"I think I need a new orbit."
"They want to kill me or be me! Either way it's kinda all about me."
"Love will tear us apart... If the creatures from an alternate dimension don't first."
"I fight for love, justice and beauty!... But mostly beauty."
"Starlight will prevail!"
"You can't judge a girl just by how she looks!... Except for me, of course."
"My soul is in the sky..."
"Sometimes, we have to change the stars."
"People follow stars, Kiko. But what do stars follow?"
"Love and hope spring forth from the stars! That's worth fighting for!"
"I can't help it if I woke up like this."
"Speed of light? No problem."
"Ugh. I do not have time for this."
"Hey! Kiko!..."
"Oh, cut it out!"
"Ugh, Kiko..."
"Oh, quit it Kiko!"
"Uugghhh!"
"Uh, hehe! Come here you little rascal!"
"Oh, I totally just tied that..."
"Bah! Uh, wha? Eh. Huh? Huh?"
"Magical Girl Make-up tip: Moisturize with the tears of your enemies."
"If looks could kill, you'd already be dead."
"Eat stardust! Maybe then you can be pretty on the inside!"
"Thanks for oversharing."
"You can't throw shade on a star!"
"Oh, don't worry! I'm way out of your league."
"Oh I heard you! I just don't care!"
"How about a line I haven't heard? Then I'll be impressed."
"Talk to the tails cause this fox isn't listening."
"I'm a little busy... can I ignore you later?"
"Ugh, puh-lease!"
"Ugh. I do not have time for this."
"By starlight!"
"Hey! The starlight in my eyes is up here!"
"Yes, I'm the popular one."
"Hey, the stars called, they want you dead."
"By the First Star, I will totally punish you!"
"I will defend the stars!"
"Come on and fight like a girl!"
"I am stronger than starlight."
"Put your heart into it!"
"I was voted 'Most likely to kill you.'"
"Wanna know a secret? Too bad!"
"Ugh. You're going to fight me wearing that?"
"I'll be nicer if you get smarter!"
"I'm so over this!"
"I've totally got this."
"You need to lighten up!"
"I don't mean to tease, it's just so easy!"
"Awww, did you want my attention?"
"Yeah, keep chasing stars. See where that gets you."
"Me looking for trouble is like you chasing my tail!"
"I'm smiling because I'm going to hit you in the face!"
"You're kinda cute when you're losing."
"Here's a twinkle in your eye."
"Your inner star is an ugly colour."
"Ew! I don't like you."
"Why yes, I did just fall from heaven!"
"Petty is so close to pretty... just not close enough."
"There's a black hole where your personality should be."
"I'm the first and LAST star you'll see tonight!"
"This is how you know I like you."
"Wanna see something cute?"
"I'm going to kill you. That's what the fox says."
"Kiko here tells me you're full of it!"
"Go get'em, Kiko!"
"Let's show'em starlight, Kiko!"
"You're such a show off, Kiko!"
"Time to grow up, star boy."
"All that sparkle and still no personality."
"There's more at stake than glitter bombs."
"You're gonna need to turn the psycho wayyy down."
"Hey! Your crazy is showing."
"Nice planet you've got here Lux."
"Before you judge, remember... I am your future."
"Nothing personal, Sarah."
"I just can't even."
"Innocence is going to get you killed."
"I'm not doing this for you."
"You look like one of those girls who hang out under the bleachers."
"O. M. G. It can speak."
"If I throw a stick, will you leave?"
"Stop trying to make fetch happen..."
"Your boyfriend called, again..."
"Playtime's over, Baron!"
"Ugh, total dragon breath."
"Someone tutor me in algebra while we slay this dragon."
"Starlight Reflection!"
"Time to ignite some stardust!"
"Stardust power activate!"
"Let's light'em up!"
"Hey there!"
"Charmed, I'm sure."
"Oh?"
"Oh, you're cute. What a waste."
"Come closer..."
"Let's be young forever...!"
"Maybe I like you, maybe not."
"Being bad does have its charms."
"Let's pretend this is love."
"This will make your heart go Supernova."
"Say hello to your teen dream."
"Kiko Spirit Dash!"
"Maximum sass achieved!"
"Oh Kiko... You can dance on the corpse of the next one."
"No Kiko, they dress that way on purpose."
"Everyone sparkles, I'm just a tiny bit brighter!"
"Young love never lasts."
"Learn to take a hint."
*Giggles* "My bad!"
"Next time, I'll try caring! I promise."
"That was totally worth it!"
"I love the sound you make when you shut up."
"How embarrassing. For you."
"Too bad, so sad."
"Overreact much?"
"Chase the light, and you're going to get burned!"
"Bad choices make the best stories."
"Jealousy is an illness. Hope you get better soon."
"I know, that was totes unfair!"
"I'm the girl your team told you not to worry about."
"Aww, sad face... just kidding."
"Jealous much?"
"How tragic."
"I totally meant that."
"Looks like someone forgot how to be awesome."
"Keep trying! You'll get there."
"That's not swagger! That's sparkle."
*Giggles* "Oops!"
"Being bad feels preety good, huh?"
"No regrets..."
"Not everyone has what it takes."
"Don't lose your sparkle!"
"It takes more than stardust to get this right."
"True stars defy darkness!"
"Crushed it!"
"You were dulling my twinkle."
*Giggles* "That was sooo much fun!"
"Don't like me? I'll try to remember to cry about it later."
"Go ahead. Eat your heart out."
"Done-zo!"
"I don't think death is your colour!"
"That was amaze-balls!"
"Haters gonna hate."
"I guess you couldn't hang with the cool kids!"
"It's not the big lies that tear us apart, Janna! It's the little secrets."
"Just a rebel without a cause..."
"Not everything is starshine and rainbows..."
"Suck it up, Starlight."
"Being a good girl can get you killed!"
"We're not sisters, just strangers with memories."
"You were never alone."
"Sorry, sister."
"Lemme guess, hammer?"
"Sacrifice was always in your destiny!"
"So pure... So bright..."
"Destiny is crueler than you can imagine."
"Mystery did have its charm... just not enough."
"There are no good girls gone wrong. Just bad girls found out."
"Awkward!"
"For the last time, the sparkles are for Star Guardians!"
"Burning bright has a price."
"Next time, burn brighter."
"Some stars were meant to fall!"
"All stars burn out eventually."
"Some stars have it, some don't."
"The best defense is a good offense."
"Just one more!"
"It's hard to be humble when you've got this much sparkle!"
"Hashtag Killing it!"
"Yum... strawberry!"
"Totally worth the calories!"
"Star guardians gotta stay hydrated!"
"The stars see everything!"
"Time for a fox-eye view!"
"Eyes on the prize!"
"A New Horizon" plays. *Giggles* "Just a fox on the run!"
"Byeee!"
"I'm just too magical for this. Laters!"
"Destiny can't catch me."
*Giggles* "Shine on!"
"Goodbye... Kiko..."
"Tell them... I tried..."
"Come on Kiko! Time to play!"
"Seize the day! Starlight doesn't last forever."
"My fight isn't over!"
"Stars don't quit! We're reborn!"
"Good girls get even!"
"Everything finds its way to the spirit realm eventually. Our opponents seem eager to get there quickly."
"Hello everyone! I'm Ahri. I'll be your guide to the afterlife."
"Oh. I'm here early. Usually I don't show up until after someone dies."
"Well, we're here. Might as well have some fun. Who's up for a spirited chase?"
"Hey, another spirit! Meet any interesting mortals lately? Me neither."
"Careful. If you see a light out there... don't follow it."
"Death is so full of life."
"Spirits can't find their way without me."
"I wonder what it's like... to meet me."
"Moving forward's not so hard."
"Life must be so wondrous."
"You can't find peace standing still."
"Run faster! Ehehe!"
"Mortals. Slow to learn, quick to follow."
"Death isn't a cycle, just a moment."
"Mortals can't help but chase death."
"Spirits follow wherever I go."
"It's only a hunt if there's prey."
"I wish I could hear all the stories they tell about me."
"Usually spirits follow me without question. I prefer a chase."
"Spirits are too light for heavy burdens."
"Mortals have two choices, follow me, or don't."
"Must spirits run everywhere? Exhausting."
"I should get out of the spirit realm more often."
"Life moves pretty quick, but never faster than me."
"Mortals struggle so fiercely, fun!"
"Every spirit forgets itself eventually, but I'm always on their horizon."
"Souls may forget they've ever lived. Obsession begins when they forget they've died."
"Mortals never stop running around and they're so serious about it."
"Spirits wear masks, but they can't always... take them off."
"What's so good about life? You just forget it all."
"Lingering spirits lose themselves, but me? I never get lost."
"Mortals see death as a patient hunter, but it's not after them."
"The spirit realm is so quiet. This is a nice change of pace."
"The forest goes on forever. It only stops... when you do."
"Ah, Cassiopeia. The temptress... without the charm."
"Wolf! Lamb! Play with me!"
"Can Lillia come out to play?"
"Riven, how much of you is lost to that blade?"
"Teemo, you're so cute. No idea why the others find you so annoying."
"Greetings Thresh. Count your spirits lately?"
"Careful, Vayne. Pretend hunters get real fangs."
"Hello, Yasuo. Did you ever figure out a leaf's purpose?"
"Yone! Don't worry! I think you're just as cool as your little brother."
"Show me your... teeth! Rawr!"
"Ooooh. Ferocious."
"Let's go hunting! ...Maybe another time?"
"Hear that?"
"Most don't forget their sense of humor... unless you never had one?"
"Don't linger!"
"Poor unfortunate souls!"
"Get lost!"
"You'll get through this."
"Follow the fox!"
"Uh-uh-uhhh."
"Death is simple!"
"Pounce!"
"Tag!"
"Time to move on!"
"Keep up!"
"It's time to let go!"
"Let's play!"
"That's the spirit!"
"Chase... and play!"
"Lost and... found!"
"Snakes! Gross!"
"Wake up Lillia!"
"Your chains are illusion Thresh!"
"Hasagi!"
"Which brother are you again?"
"Spirits are calling!"
"Cute, aren't they?"
"Time to show them the way."
"Spirit-fire!"
"Hello little spirits."
"Follow."
"Rest now."
"Don't get lost."
"Isn't this easier?"
"I won't lead you astray."
"Find me, find yourself."
"Found you!"
"Forget everything."
"Your path is clear."
"My favorite part."
"Playtime's just beginning!"
"Run with me!"
"A chase then!"
"Ehehe! That was fun!"
"You've earned your rest."
"One more soul to greet."
"Don't worry. I'm here for the next part too."
"Go and wander awhile."
"It's time for you to go."
"Get in touch with your spiritual side."
"I know it's hard to let go."
"You'll have more fun in your afterlife."
"What else can I chase?"
"When all goes dark, you'll see a fox. Follow it."
"Ehehe! Thanks for playing!"
"I hope you're happy now."
"All you've got to do next is forget."
"Got your tail! Ehehe!"
"Farewell Wolf, Lamb. Let's play again soon!"
"I hope you find peace this time, Lillia."
"You'll never catch me dragging that sword around."
"Sorry, Teemo, I'm much better at hide and seek."
"You've reached your threshold. Ehehe!"
"You need claws to hunt, Vayne."
"Death is like the wind."
"I accept your surrender, Yone."
"I really enjoy my work!"
"Even spirit should make time for peaceful moments."
"A good rest is the best part of the job."
"Ugh. I'll..see myself out."
"Tag... I'm... it."
"Hey... it's... me."
"I got caught up in the chase."
"Hmph. Didn't need a guide for that one."
"Ugh. Like chasing your own tails..."
"Welcome to Summoner's Rift!"
"Time to sparkle."
"Ready or not, it's time to sparkle."
"It's go time."
"Welcome to the Howling Abyss!"
"Welcome to the Howling Abyss! Watch out for the icy patch."
"Welcome to the Twisted Treeline!"
"Welcome to the Twisted Treeline! Spooky."
"Welcome to the Crystal Scar!"

"Oh! That looked fun."
"That's one way to beat back the darkness."

"By the first star, that was hot!"
"Shine on!"
"You have been slain."
"You have been slain."

"Better luck next time!"
"Awkward."
"Uh uh, deadsies."
