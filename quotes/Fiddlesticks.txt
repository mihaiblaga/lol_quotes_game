"Fear..."
"Afraid..."
"It's hunting us. It knows what we're afraid of."
"Don't be scared. It can't hurt you."
"To our end."
"Come closer. Closer..."
"Fiddlesticks... Fiddlesticks..."
"I hear crows."
"It moves around at night."
"All alone. Lost in the dark."
"I'll help you. Follow my voice..."
"Is someone there?"
"There's something in the field."
"I'm lost. Won't anybody help me?"
"I'm so scared."
"See? It's just a scarecrow."
"Nothing to be afraid of."
"It's dark I can't find my way."
"Who's out there? Show yourself."
"Hungry."
"I'm coming to help. Where are you? I can't see you. I. Can't. See you."
"High above the rotten rows. Cloth and metal. Teeth and crows."
"Through the field. Down the lane. Voices never heard again!"
"Fiddlesticks is just a fable. A story to scare children."
"They haven't come back from the fields. It's been three days."
"Fid-dle-sticks. End of men. Fid-dle-sticks. First of ten!"
"Once upon a time... once... upon a time!"
"Annie... help me... Annie..."
"Evelynn..."
"Garen... brother... please don't hate me..."
"Jinx! All your fault! All your fault!"
"Grey man..."
"Little... light..."
"Sarah... Sarah..."
"Nocturne..."
"I'm always here. My. Little. Hero."
"Guilty. Guilty. Guilty."
"Stars..."
"Raum..."
"Vannis... don't hurt her..."
"Tahm... Kench..."
"Vayne. Give... us... a smile..."
"Brother... how could you... betray us?"
"De... ma... ci... a."
"Afraid?"
"Don't open your eyes!"
"Are you afraid?"
"Run!"
"Don't leave me!"
"Nooo!"
"It's real!"
"It won't die!"
"Please, no!"
"Fear!"
"Let me in!"
"The scarecrow?"
"Save me!"
"Monster!"
"We can't get out!"
"It's here!"
"It's alive!"
"Demon!"
"Help me!"
"Open the door!"
"No! No!"
"It's in the house!"
"Keep running!"
"Cut!"
"Cutting!"
"Reap!"
"Sow!"
"Shear!"
"Fear!"
"Harvest!"
"It's still out there."
"Fiddle... stiiiicksss..."
"Monsters..."
"You're not... real..."
"So... afraid..."
"Just a story..."
"Annie... don't let go..."
"Agony."
"For... Demacia..."
"Everybody... panic..."
"Lamb... tell me a story..."
"Little light. Little light."
"Hide, Sarah... hide..."
"Nightmares."
"Willump... I'll save you..."
"What is broken... can be reforged..."
"Stars... hear me..."
"Secrets."
"Share... and... share... alike..."
"Addiction."
"The dark should fear me..."
"Follow the wind..."
"The scarecrow took them all. Nobody left. But me."
"What is that? What is that?"
"Horror..."
"Fear..."
"It's not dead."
"Reap and sow. Reap and sow."
"Hey there, kids! Say hello to your old pal... Fiddlesticks!"
"Send in... the clown."
"Let's get this surprise party started!"
"Is everybody happy?"
"Anybody want a balloon animal?!"
"They'll laugh! They'll cry! They'll die!"
"No one ever asks 'How's the evil clown?'"
"I believe the word you're looking for is... coulrophobia."
"Laughter is the best medicine."
"There's a clown on the loose? Where?"
"I put my giant shoes on one peg leg at a time."
"Like the gloves? Be sure to give 'em a hand!"
"The end... is near."
"Today we're gonna party and the party won't stop!"
"I'm Fiddlesticks and I'm my own thing."
"Get a load of my comic antics."
"What joy. What terror!"
"It's deadly fun... to play the fool."
"With Fiddlesticks, every party is killer!"
"This surprise party is just gettin' started."
"I'm a real social butterfly."
"Did someone order a clown-o-gram?"
"Will everyone die? Let's party and find out."
"Life is a party. Die for it."
"A little celebrating never killed anyone."
"Live for today, plan for tomorrow, and die tonight!"
"Maybe the real surprise was the friends we killed along the way."
"Yeah baby..."
"You know it's the laughter that keeps me going. And the screams!"
"Must've caught something. I've been feeling a little... funny, lately!"
"Who's the special birthday kid, hm? Everybody?! Now that's what I like to hear!"
"I haven't got a brain, and soon... neither will anyone else!"
"It's the most fun in the park... when you're laughing in the dark."
"Clowning is an art. An art I take... very seriously."
"The laughter never dies. It's real, it's strong, and it's my friend!"
"Is it a demon, or is it a clown? Let's try a lot of both!"
"I used to think life was a comedy. Now I know... it's a horror show!"
"The worst part of clowning? No life insurance."
"Hello, little boy. Are you afraid of clowns?"
"Hello, little girl. Not afraid of  clowns  are you?"
"Kiss me, fat man!"
"Nice key you got there, twilight. Didn't steal it from someone dangerous did you?"
"What the hell are you supposed to be? Nobody ordered a cake! Get out!"
"You just understand me, meme robot and horrible, tiny child."
"Put on your party dress and die."
"You're gonna be the life of the party!"
"Yeah taunt the demon clown. That always works out great."
"Wanna hear a joke? It's a riot!"
"Sorry, I'm... really fallin' apart out here."
"Unless you've got some deeply creative clown puns, I'm not interested."
"Welcome to clown town!"
"I'm not clownin' around!"
"Time to cut the cake!"
"Open your presents!"
"I'm a real cut-up."
"Are you down with the clown?"
"Here comes the clown show!"
"Party time!"
"Blow out the candles!"
"It's somebody's special day!"
"Here's a funny trick!"
"Knock, knock! Who's there?"
"You're hysterical."
"And many moooore!"
"Congratulations!"
"The spotlight's on you!"
"I crave laughter."
"Let's turn that frown upside down."
"Wanna see a party trick?"
"Let's celebrate!"
"Honk!"
"Having fun yet?"
"Want a balloon?"
"Ring-a-ding-ding!"
"Smile!"
"Hey-hey kids!"
"Clowns are always happy."
"You're in clown country."
"Hey there. Wanna party?"
"I could use a light snack."
"Do the monster mash."
"You'll make some lovely gift bags."
"Gimme those party favors!"
"Clowns. Their only weakness."
"There's only room for one monster out here!"
"These monsters just aren't up to par... ty. Eh? Eh?!"
"Welcome to the party! Now DIE!"
"Soon, we'll have enough clowns for a circus!"
"Tell me if you see anything, eh?"
"Don't be a dummy, dummy!"
"People love finding clowns in the dark."
"Remember to say 'Surprise!'"
"I've got fifty more in the clown car!"
"Like lookin' in a mirror."
"You're on thin ice, Mr. Giggles."
"Surprise!"
"Surprise!"
"Let me top myself off!"
"Drink it aaall in!"
"Party hard."
"Oh, yeahhh."
"Gimme the juuuice!"
"Hey there, kids."
"Surpriiiise!"
"Happy Birthdaaay!"
"Aw... all tuckered out."
"Someone's had too much excitement."
"Oh, lighten up. It's just a joke!"
"The world will never know a greater clown than you."
"Here's your nose and rainbow wig. You earned 'em!"
"Who's the clown now?"
"I had a blast. Let's do it again next year!"
"Well? Were you surprised?"
"And what a party it was."
"Careful with those birthdays. Too many can kill you!"
"Well. I think it's time to bring joy back into the world."
"That... was a total clown fiesta. I love it!"
"Don't worry, kids! Fiddlesticks will be right back."
"Everyone, take your places! When I get back, we'll unveil a big surprise."
"It's my party and everyone will die if I want them to!"
"That wasn't funny."
"I'm not laughing anymore."
"This is the part where things get a little... dark."
"The crows are circling... "
"Why aren't you afraid?!"
"GG!"
"Annie... help me... Annie..."
"Annie... don't let go..."
"Grey man..."
"Little... light..."
"Little light. Little light."
"Vannis... don't hurt her..."
"Raum..."
"Sarah... Sarah..."
"Hide, Sarah... hide..."
"Share... and... share... alike..."
"Jinx! All your fault! All your fault!"
"It's the most fun in the park... when you're laughing in the dark."
