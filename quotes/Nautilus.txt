"Beware the depths."
"I will not rest."
"The tide ebbs."
"The endless march."
"Forward, forward."
"Left to die."
"Find the guilty."
"Peer into the darkness."
"Echoes from the deep."
"Lost and forgotten."
"Do you hear them calling?"
"I will have vengeance."
"Drag them down."
"Fear the ocean's weight."
"All will drown."
"They will pay."
"I will not rest."
"You are in the deep end now!"
Nautilus plants his anchor in the ground and 'swims' in the air.
"Sometimes I think this anchor just weighs me down."
Nautilus laughs.
Nautilus laughs.
Nautilus laughs.
