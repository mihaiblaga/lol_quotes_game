"Once a Bandle gunner, always a Bandle gunner!"
"Let me get in there!"
"I call frontline."
"I bravely volunteer to charge in recklessly!"
"Locked, loaded, and ready to rocket!"
"Walking tall."
"Where's the action?"
"Bring on the bad guys!"
"Who wears a helmet?"
"Get in my way. I dare ya."
"I dare you to dare me."
"You don't hurt 'em if you don't hit 'em."
"Sometimes outnumbered; never outgunned."
"Let me get in there!"
"Winners don't duck."
"Let's get this party started!"
"I just need a point in the right direction."
"I might just drop in."
"A Bandle Gunner never turns tail. Unless it's to taunt you."
"Orders are more like guidelines, really."
"Wanna see the fireworks?"
"If it's worth shooting once, it's probably worth shooting a lot!"
"You think you can outshoot me?"
"You make it easy to be unimpressed."
"Tada."
"Anyone ever tell you you're a little clingy?"
"Is that gun full-sized?"
"Try to keep up, old-timer."
"You're not the only Yordle who knows how to fly, Corki."
"When you find the right gun, you only need one."
"Aw, Veigar! You're cute when you're angry."
"Oh, Veigar! Tell me all about your diabolical plan."
"Watch where you're exploding, Ziggs!"
"Is that a rocket in your pocket?"
"Please allow my cannon and I to conflict resolve."
"This is my 357 caliber handgun."
"A cannonball is the best icebreaker!"
"Hey, specs. What's cooking?"
"Nice suit, Rumble! What d'you call it?"
"Eyes on the enemy, Rumble."
"Um, Teemo, are these mushrooms your rations or your ammo?"
Tristana laughs.
Tristana laughs.
Tristana laughs.
Tristana laughs.
"Let 'em come by land, by sea or air! Send 'em running home when the Bandle Gunners blare!"
"One stump high and ten stumps tall! Bandle Gunners show 'em all!"
"Bandle Gunners, what'd you see? Sir, just smoke and victory!"
Tristana hums.
"I'm going in!"
"Engaging!"
"Let's get in range!"
"I can eyeball it!"
"Nothing a little gunpowder won't fix!"
"Check the kick on this sucker!"
"Things are heating up!"
"Watch this."
"Here comes the boom!"
"I got this one!"
"We've got this!"
"Light 'em up!"
"Direct hit!"
"Boomer says hi."
"Ready, aim, fire!"
"War stories don't write themselves."
"Blast 'em!"
"They joined the wrong army!"
"Leave it to me!"
"Hey, where'd you go?"
"Get chunked."
"Double time!"
"Fire at will!"
"Don't let up!"
"Now we're cooking!"
"Who wants some? You want some? Come on!"
"More where that came from."
"Look out below!"
"Blast off!"
"Just passin' through!"
"Up and over!"
"Short cut!"
"Surprise!"
"Didn't see that coming, did you?"
"Thanks for breaking my fall!"
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Oh boy!"
"Eep!"
"Can't touch this!"
"Almost!"
"Whoa!"
"Retreat!"
"Maybe I cut that a little close. Maybe."
"Any landing you can walk away from..."
"I was never worried!"
"Need a breather..."
"Aha, haha, ha... that was scary."
"Can't wait to tell the recruits about that one!"
"Stuck him."
"Hold this."
"Mind the fuse."
"Tag."
"Tick tock."
"Clock's ticking."
"Haha, you're in trouble now."
"Dropping like flies!"
"Thanks for clumping!"
"Keep 'em coming!"
"Clean sweep."
"Pfft. Cannon fodder."
"Nothing like overkill!"
"Target freaking annihilated!"
"Now you see him, now you don't."
"How's that for a Bandle City beatdown?"
"Nope!"
"See ya."
"Cannonball!"
"Over there, buster!"
"Hi there!"
"Hands off!"
"Point blank is the only blank I like!"
"Air mail!"
"Boo!"
"Pilot to bombardier!"
"Bombs away!"
"You should try fanning out!"
"Do you sell earplugs too?"
"Oh, that looks cool!"
"Is this blastproof?"
"Let's see if this makes it through the first explosion."
"Can't wait to try this out."
"Ooh, I like the look of this baby!"
"Does this make me royalty?"
"Sweet! Kinda gross but sweet!"
"It can keep the blood. I'm thirsty for action."
"All the risk and none of the consequences? I'm sold!"
"Time to live dangerously."
"Some people like backup plans. I like 'charge in' plans!"
"Infinity anything is pretty awesome."
"If there's a sword for making things explode, this is it."
"It won't be so much a whisper as a deafening explosion."
"Cannons versus armor; cannons win."
"I don't take cover. I take cover out."
"No slowing me down now!"
"Perfect for cutting loose!"
"Nets, snares, vines, meet your worst nightmare."
"Time to fill up my dance card!"
"This'll put a little zing on things!"
"Ooh, look! I'm a shock trooper!"
"Who needs a fort?"
"You're gonna need a bigger castle."
"Bringing down the house!"
"Huff, puff, boom."
"On lookout."
"Watch the brush."
"Eyes open."
"Watching our backs."
"Time for some rearm and redeploy!"
"Falling back!"
"Back to base!"
"Back to the action!"
"Gotta get back out there!"
"Up and at 'em!"
"Two-fer!"
"Score!"
"Full house!"
"Just how much bigger are you gonna' get?"
"Ouch! Watch the horns... and the teeth... and the tail!"
"He's just going through a phase. I think."
"I've got a dragon and I'm not afraid to use him."
"Be good and I'll let you burn down a building or two." (Riggle growls)
"Who's a good Riggle?" (Riggle moans) "That's right, you are." (Riggle sniffs)
"When do dragons start flying?"
"Hey, no chewing on me."
"We're in this together, Riggle."
"Why are you slimy?"
"Is there anything you don't eat?"
"It's scary what comes out of you."
"Not the biggest dragon, but the best."
"Do I know how to accessorize?"
"Let's find you a snack."
"Tell me you don't have fleas."
"When you get bigger, you're carrying me."
"I broke you out of that egg and I can stuff you back in!"
(Riggle growls) "I know, I'm going."
"Where to next?" (Riggle growls)
"You really are a handful." (Riggle moans)
"We are so starting obedience training." (Riggle moans)
"You need a bath." (Riggle moans)
"Someone's on their best behaviour." (Riggle growls)
(Riggle moans) "We'll eat later, stop pouting." (Riggle grunts)
"You're stuck with me now." (Riggle grunts)
"Are all dragons this heavy?" (Riggle growls)
"Aw, look at your little arms! (Riggle growls)
(Riggle growls) "Keep dreaming, buddy." (Riggle growls)
(Riggle growls) "Did you get into the sugar again?" (Riggle growls)
(Riggle growls) "I'll scratch your tummy later!" (Riggle grunts)
(Riggle moans) "This is so not the time!" (Riggle grunts)
(Riggle growls) "I really hope that was your stomach."
(Riggle growls)
(Riggle growls)
(Riggle grumbles)
(Riggle growls)
(Riggle growls)
Riggle shoots a jet of flame into the air.
"You're playing with fire now!"
"My dragon will eat you!"
"Not a great time to be you right now!"
"Feeling a little nervous?"
"I think we got their attention!"
"Oh, look! Chicken flambe!"
"Extra crispy, coming right up!"
"How about a little fire, scarecrow?"
"Cool eagle, what does it breathe? Air?"
"Who's got the flamespitter now?"
(Riggle growls) "Yep, her name's Shyvana. I think she's confused."
Tristana attempts to perform tricks with Riggle but gets breathed in the face with fire.
"Ready? Play dead! ... good."
"Trick? Roll over! ... every time."
"Ready? Aim...! ... not at me."
"Riggle! Speak! ... close enough."
"Isn't fire just the best?"
"Pretty cool bear. Have you seen my dragon?"
"Uh... have you and Riggle already met?"
"We make a pretty great pair, don't we, Rumble? Just me and this dragon."
Tristana laughs.
Tristana laughs.
Tristana laughs.
Tristana laughs.
Tristana makes Riggle dance.
Tristana hums.
"Roast 'em!"
"Beware of dragon."
"Riggle says hi."
"The fire means he likes you."
"Fire solves most problems."
"Just try to get between us!"
"Well, you made him angry."
"Light a fire under 'em."
"He likes his food well done."
"Hold on to your harness!"
"This is no time for molting!"
"Who wants to lose some eyebrows?"
"You're looking mighty flammable right now."
"Wanna see a fireball?"
"This is a dragon 'hello'."
"Dragons are just cheating."
"Don't mind us."
"I could stop him... but I won't."
"Show him what you can do!" (Riggle growls)
"Let's have some fun!" (Riggle growls)
"He views flame-retardant as a challenge!" (Riggle growls)
(Riggle growls) "Save it for the bad guys!"
"Now we're cooking!"
"Warmup time!"
"Whoa, whoa!"
"Liftoff!"
"Gotta' fly!"
"Up!"
"Met my dragon?"
"Miss us?"
"Dragon up close!"
"Got 'em!"
"Dragon snipe!"
"Yikes!"
"Uh oh!"
"Eek!"
"You were totally scared." (Riggle moans)
"Oh I was never worried." (Riggle scoffs)
"Smoke 'em out!"
"Burn!"
"Need some fire?"
"Get that one!"
"Later."
"Fireball."
"Now!"
"Whoosh."
"No petting."
"My dragon."
"Keep your distance."
"He's got space issues."
"Fly 'n' fry!"
"Raining fire!"
"From the sky!"
(Riggle moans) "Yep, I feel a bit safer too."
(Riggle whines) "It's not that I think we're gonna die or anything..."
"This'll look out for both of us."
"I think you're gonna like this."
"Is it just me or did you get scarier?"
"Don't mess with this dragon."
"Fire beats armor."
"No such thing as dragon-resistant."
"Last Whis-" (Riggle growls) "Yeah, good, good whisper."
"Good luck controlling this dragon."
"Like you weren't squirmy enough already."
"Don't worry, I'll keep you out of trouble." (Riggle purrs)
"I'll bet you like this cape, don't you?"
"Finally clothing that's supposed to burn!"
(Riggle growls) "Riggle-approved!"
"Uh... don't lick this."
"We'll see if they can hurt us now."
"Just what you need, a taste for blood..." (Riggle growls)
"Nope, no, don't chew that-" (bzzt)
"Careful with that, or you'll get zapped."
"Demolition dragon!"
"Take it down, Riggle!"
"He doesn't like towers."
(Riggle snores) "Stay alert!"
"I'll keep you safe."
"Riggle territory."
"Watch my back."
"Here you go!"
"Time for a little snack break!"
"Alright, you deserve it!"
"And what did we learn?" (Riggle growls)
"Don't look at me like that, it seemed like a good idea at the time."
"That... wasn't exactly how that was supposed to go." (Riggle scoffs)
"Not a word."
"Here we are!"
"Look out!"
"Haha!" (Riggle growls)
(Gasps) "What are you wearing?!"
"You monster."
"Ready for some fireworks?"
"GG!"
"Well, I had a blast!"
"The code is more what you'd call 'guidelines' than actual rules."
