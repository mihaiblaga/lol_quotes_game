"I remember starving in the sump, a pathetic little nothing of a girl. Look at me now!"
"Every fashionable Piltovan owns at least one of my products. So trusting, so naive."
"There's a reason I call the shots."
"I don't forgive debts, and I never forget them."
"Progress comes at a price others aren't willing to pay."
"Throw scraps to the hungry, and they thank you for the feast."
"Zaun deserves more."
"I don't need to get my hands dirty. Oh, but I do enjoy it."
"Ambition isn't greed."
"Zaun is not beneath Piltover, no matter how it may appear."
"She who controls the Sun Gate controls the world!"
"Most chem-barons are lackeys who failed upward."
"Years of investing in Zaun has paid off handsomely."
"Empires aren't built on enough."
"No-one even thought to invest in chemtech before I did."
"The other chem-barons fear my reach, as they should."
"Piltover will suffer for its crimes against me."
"My decanter is just one more pawn to push."
"I used to have rivals, now I have business partners."
"Wealth writes the laws that governments enforce."
"Ah, the air is so much thinner up here."
"Piltover doesn't deserve the Sun Gate."
"Competition is for the weak. I dominate."
"Who said chemtech can't be beautiful?"
"Power can be bought, much like loyalty."
"All my parents left me was my name. Now, it's worth millions."
"I love my city. But I had to burn down Zaun to smoke out Piltover, well..."
"When my parents handed out their cures, they asked for nothing, so we had nothing. Kind, but foolish."
"It's expensive to be poor. But when you're rich, they just give you things."
"Hard work is its own reward. *laughs* No, it's the money!"
"Piltover coos over perfumes... while Zaun struggles to breathe."
"I gave out breathers in exchange for Zaun's loyalty. Ha, those dividends are priceless!"
"I provide people with two options: do what I want, or do what I want but with more steps."
"Money can't buy happiness? Only someone born rich would agree with that."
"We don't have to be enemies. Let me change your mind."
"You'll come around to my side with the right incentive."
"If you're not working for me, you're working against me."
"Bold of you to stand against me."
"Do you know who I am? If you don't, you will."
"Let's not waste my time, hmm?"
"Ah, good. I can write this off as a business expense."
"I prefer my takeovers to be hostile. Indulge me."
"The difference between medicine and poison is the dosage. Allow me to demonstrate."
"Work for me or work against me, it doesn't matter. Everyone comes to my side eventually."
"Ah, my favorite part of the job: product testing."
"Alright, I've got companies to buy and a city to crush, so let's make this quick."
"Two alchemists were murdered over thirty years ago, Camille. Do you remember them?"
"How are your parents, Ekko? If only you'd let me help them."
"Where were you when we needed you most, Janna?"
"Entertaining as you are, Jinx, you're wasting both your time and your talent."
"I will choke your city and laugh as they suffocate, Piltovan."
"I bankrolled your pistols' makers, Samira. Those guns are mine by right."
"Sing your little songs of unity while you can, traitor."
"We could have done great work together, Singed. Pity."
"Piltover will fall to me, Swain, not to Noxus."
"You forgot whose money made you who you are, Viktor."
"Doesn't matter how loud you bark or how hard you bite, Vi. A lap dog's a lap dog."
"Zeri. Perhaps I would have been more like you if my parents had survived: poor and weak."
"'I'll make you kill your loved ones' is a more effective threat than any gun."
"Why must you be so constantly irksome?"
"I mean, it's one health potion. What could it cost, ten thousand gold?"
"Go away, my dear. Pray for a sense of humor."
"Oh, I love it... Hahahahahahaha!"
"Get a job!"
"High-class chemtech."
"Watch the suit!"
"Money talks."
"Worthless wretch!"
"Your value's dropped!"
"Don't hold your breath!"
"Die for me."
"I said 
jump!
"
"We're downsizing."
"I'm busy."
"Breathe deep!"
"Filth!"
"Choke!"
"Waste of my time."
"Step aside, worm!"
"Move, now!"
"Out of my way!"
"Get the job done."
"That's an order!"
"Prove your worth!"
"Don't make me ask again!"
"Sic 'em!"
"You know what to do."
"Make them pay."
"You owe me."
"Loyalty is rewarded."
"Well done, pet."
"You're welcome."
"I'll bill you later!"
"Disrupting the market!"
"I'll make a killing off of this!"
"You work for me now!"
"Kill them and suffer!"
"Step aside, worm!"
"Don't think, just do!"
"Time to make some new business partners."
"Ready to take control."
Renata laughs. "Progress."
"Never cross Renata Glasc!"
"I have no regrets, but I bet somebody does."
"Let's see hextech do that!"
"It's just business."
"Poor thing."
"You don't deserve nice things."
"My profit, your loss."
"Ah, the price of progress."
"This is why all my products are five stars."
"Your hextech won't save you."
"Give my parents my love, won't you?"
"You were regrettably expensive, my dear."
"The work is never over, and I love my work!"
"I expect to see progress when I get back."
Renata coughs. "Ugh, I need a breather."
"The boss shouldn't have to be in the factory for the work to get done."
"Is that a stain? Ugh, now I need a whole new suit!"
"Alright, let's go make my accountant cry!"
"Nothing's free. All I ask is your loyalty."
"Someday I will call upon you to do something for me."
"Let the world know the generosity of Renata Glasc."
"Remember who helped you in your hour of need."
"I'm sure my parents will be proud."
"Finally... I can see them again..."
"I'll make them forget they ever saw me stumble."
"No! I will 
not
 die before Piltover falls!"
"This decanter had better be indestructible, or somebody is getting fired!"
"Mistakes were made."
"Time to collect what I'm owed."
"Blood is a big expense. Luckily, I'm rich."
"I'm a giver."
"For the needy."
"A charitable donation."
"They ought to thank me."
"A worthy investment."
