"Hmm... let me fix that."
"Let's dance."
"Seriously? Seriously? Lame."
"My fellow travelers, you are all about to witness my majestic epicness! ... unless I get killed, but... probably not!"
"Okay, everybody, I'm here, I'm here... the party starts now!"
"Magic is in the heart. Magic is in the rhythm."
"You see this cape? Ha! I say god damn  I'm sexy!"
"I can't wait to get in there. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I am going to  get in there! "
"Xayah? Xayah? Crap. What was I supposed to do?"
"Nothing important should be taken seriously."
"War is in the dance."
"Consequences only matter if I don't get away."
"We are seen dancing and thought insane - by those who can't hear the music."
"Alright, let's go! This way or that way?"
"Stick to the plan."
"We have a plan?"
"We always have a plan."
"Huh. Really?"
"Ugh, I hate everyone today."
"I know what'll make you feel better... "
"Murdering everyone!"
"Hey, I have a plan."
"You... have a plan?"
"Yeah! I'll go on instinct!"
"That's the opposite of a plan."
"You sure about this?"
"It has to be done."
"Be safe."
"Like you can talk."
"If things go wrong---"
"They always go wrong."
"They don't  always  go wrong."
"Mostly?"
"They  mostly  go wrong."
"That's why I'm here."
"So, this mission... are we, uh...?"
"Are you pretending to be dumb?"
"Well, I mean... I don't have to remember the plan if you do."
"When are we going to do this?"
"Soon, baby. Slow down."
"Our magic is a fury. It is a song you cannot resist."
"Should I be... running? Yeah, I should... probably be running."
"I look around these forests and I see freedom. I hear the music."
"Crap. I totally forgot why I'm here."
"I am only as wild as magic."
"Magic is supposed to be scary. Love is supposed to hurt. Ecstasy needs a little fear."
"If you aren't a little frightened, you ain't alive."
"They've never seen moves like mine."
"Magic is a wilderness."
"Humans made promises. More than I can remember. They kept none."
"Humans talk about their treaties. We talk about their lies."
"Long ago, our kind danced upon the mountains like flames. Now only the embers remain."
"I dance because I'm free!"
"The only way to understand magic is to plunge into it, move with it, dance and dance!"
"I'm getting impatient."
"Gotta get myself hyped, okay... one, two... one, two... woo! Alright!"
"The humans call it battle. It's just a dance."
"I feel like my allies aren't recognising how amazing my cloak is! I mean, seriously! Rude!"
"They will see my dance, then they will know magic's joy... and its fury."
"Okay, Rakan, get 'em watching you, then you burn 'em up."
"I look good, I feel good, let's kick some ass!"
"I got my look right, I got my moves right... time to show it!"
"They will remember my name!"
"I'm gonna' live forever!"
"I'm going to take all they got, then laugh as I throw it away."
"I've been kicked around since I was born. It's alright! It's okay! I'm staying alive!"
"They will see me. They will see my dance!"
"I will walk in. I will dance. They will party."
"Name one genius that ain't crazy."
"Ha! I'm G to the D! Golden diamonds, boy! Woo!"
"I'm just trying to live the moment."
"I don't need anything - but the right now."
"Man, have you seen that forest over there?"
"I got freedom, I got a lady, I got a cause I'd die for. That's who I am."
"Don't leave nothing! Bring it all!"
"Time to get it started!"
"I don't need to understand the plan! I trust my love."
"It's all filthy and dangerous - and that's why I love it!"
"I miss Xayah."
"Fun. I need some fun. Now."
"Why is it taking so long to get back to the action?"
"It's a revolution. And it's good times."
"I'm offended by how little attention I was given."
"Humans think that to believe in something, you have to be serious about it. That's their problem."
"They ain't ready for what I'm bringing!"
"Ain't nothing I say should be taken seriously! That's why it's the truth!"
"This looks like another dangerous situation. Thankfully, I can improvise."
"They're gonna' try and test me? Haha!"
"Danger is as fun as you let it be."
"I am definitely more confident in dangerous situations."
"I have got to stop talking to myself. Damnit, Xayah, where are you?"
"You're only given a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it."
"I can't wait to see what I'm going to do."
"There's wildness in the bees and the flowers. It's just a fury humans don't see."
"I am Vastaya. I am born of magic. This is my destiny."
"Is my cloak right? Yes it is! I was worried there for a second."
"Magic isn't supposed to be safe."
"They're scared of darkness, they're scared of magic. They are scared of where I'm from."
"They ain't seen moves like mine."
"It's magic that's wild. I'm just here for the party."
"For humans, magic is like fire. For us, it is water and air."
"Ladies and gentleman, I am here to entertain! Myself, mostly - but you too!"
"Humans claim it is theirs. They fence us away and cover it in refuse."
"It don't take a lot of words to tell the truth."
"Our people are bleeding. My lady's gonna' heal them."
"I don't want a world that's safe."
"I don't want a war - but I want to be free."
"What human's call magic, we call life."
"I'm here! I'm gone, I am so gone."
"I can't die looking this good!"
"I am a chronic line-stepper."
"I dance because I'm free."
"If Xayah says someone has to die, they die - and they deserved it."
"Woo! I am so into this! What is this?"
"If it don't get out of control, it ain't a party."
"I think they underestimate my charm. How is that even possible?"
"I'm so fine, I gotta kiss myself!"
"They think they can catch me."
"I don't do safe."
"The universe loves me."
"They want us in cages. We refuse."
"I need my love to hurt. I need the world to be scary. I don't apologise for it! I feel good!"
"I'm gonna' burn this place down, then help them build it back up - so I can burn it again!"
"I dance so fine I kill."
"Xayah? Hey! Damn, where is she? I hate it when she leaves."
"Without wild magic, we have no children, we have no future."
"When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story."
"I do not wish to kill the mortals. I want them to hear the music."
"The humans will never understand our kind until they hear the song."
"I will make them dance. I will make them hear."
" Hey, Xayah."
"Yeah?"
"You sexy."
"Keep them distracted."
"That shouldn't be a problem."
"You okay?"
"I'm fine."
"You're pushing yourself too hard."
"It has to be done."
"Where are we going?"
"You forgot the plan."
"No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?"
"You remember the Aphae waterfall?"
"Yeah."
"I'd like to go there again."
"Well, try not to die then."
"Darling?"
"Yes?"
"Pay attention to me."
"What the hell were you thinking?"
"Back there?"
"Yes."
"I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking."
"How can humans not hear the magic?"
"They're too busy building things."
"Why?"
"Because... they're afraid."
"Thanks."
"For what?"
"Not saying 'I told you so.'"
"Okay, last time, it was totally my fault."
"What was?"
"Good answer."
"You going to marry me today?"
"Ask me again tomorrow."
"I always do."
"Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?"
"Not now!"
"Love is so cruel!"
"What's after this?"
"Another road, another horizon."
"Hm. Good."
"It's gonna' be okay."
"We can do this."
"Hey, I know that."
"You know I love you."
"What we have is greater than some human word."
"Did you notice the sky?"
"It's lovely."
"Not as beautiful as you."
"I am R-r-r-akan!"
"Ugh, what's with the accent?"
"I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?"
"No. No, I do not."
"If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?"
"Hubba hubba."
"No, that's not whistling."
"If you don't want to do this... "
"No! I want to!"
"You're only here because of me."
"... nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me."
"What are those things humans wear on their feet?"
"Shoes."
"I need shoes. Red ones. I need them  so  bad."
"Did I tell you I love you?"
"Yes... but say it anyway."
"I love you."
"Why do you never say yes?"
"'cause then... I wouldn't get to hear you ask."
"Can we just stay here?"
"We must keep moving."
"Aw... "
"Xayah? I think we got a problem... "
"Think, or know?"
"I...  know  we got a problem?"
"I'm so tired... "
"You gotta rest, honey."
"Everyone is depending on me."
"Everyone can wait."
"What would you do if I died?"
"I would... burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever."
"Aw... that's sweet."
"I think scars are sexy."
"Okay. I'll get more."
"Where do we go?"
"Wherever our hearts desire."
"How do you like me today?"
"More than yesterday, less than tomorrow."
"Do I make you happy, Rakan?"
"Every day of my life."
"I'm lucky to have you."
"No. I'm the lucky one."
"I swear, you will be the death of me."
"I'm fine with that."
"Me too."
"If we get separated, I'll find you."
"We won't get separated."
"You're already wandering off."
"No, I'm not! ... only a little."
"You are stunning and beautiful... "
"Why, thank you, darling."
"Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey."
"I need you to be more careful."
"If anybody's gonna' die first, it's gonna' be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a  terrible  color on me."
"Play it safe!"
"Baby, I don't do safe!"
"You okay?"
"Oh, this is all so intense!"
"You can't tell me you weren't impressed!"
"With what?"
"Just generally! I'm amazing!"
"Honey, what are you doing?"
"I can't die looking this good!"
"After this, how about we get some human food?"
"A nice dinner?"
"Chocolate!"
"That's not what---"
"We're eating chocolate!"
"Do you remember the plan?"
"Nope, but let's do it!"
"I have a cunning plan."
"Really? What is it?"
"I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!"
"I think you intimidate human females."
"Yeah, so?"
"It's kinda hot!"
"Should I show them the dance?"
"Show them the dance."
"You thinking about me?"
"I'm a little busy!"
"That's very upsetting!"
"Baby, what did I tell you?"
"Try not to die?"
"Close enough."
"Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?"
"Yeah, gross."
"Rakan has arrived!"
"I saw you. Everyone can see you."
"Yeah! That's what I like!"
"Can I start off?"
"You want to start it off?"
"Let's start it off!"
"I'm a humble entertainer!"
"Really, darling?"
"Yeah, I'm the best."
"Who is that gorgeous thing over there?"
"Now's not the time, darling."
"It's always the time!"
"Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey."
"Hi."
"I'm handling it, dear."
"Are you?"
"I was, I--- I will."
"How long do we fight?"
"Until we are free. Until magic is free."
"Is that after lunch?"
"Do you remember our escape route?"
"Uh... yes?"
"I'll take that as a no."
"How will we know if the plan works?"
"We'll still be alive!"
"Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!"
"I am not a piece of meat."
"Caw caw, caw caw!"
"You used the secret call! Is everything alright?"
"We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!"
"Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just... go that way!"
"No-one can control me!"
"That's right, babe."
"Look sharp, baby."
"Ha! When don't I?"
"If I vanished, what would you do?"
"I would never be whole again."
"Am I good to you?"
"The best."
"I'm going rogue!"
"There's a surprise."
"Be right back!"
"Will you?"
"Who can know these things?"
"You! You can know these things!"
"I love you!"
"I know."
"Heh, like this... " Rakan sings. Rakan sings. Rakan sings. "Oh, here we go again. Mhm. Mister Scatman, uh huh. ... oh, he's got me going now... "
"Sing it with me, baby."
"I don't know the words."
"You know, I ain't really about making fun of people, but you... make that difficult."
"I got three rules. You're breaking two of them with that outfit."
"Can we just get started already?"
"Why are you so boring?"
"Man, are you digging this air?"
"Oh, you're bumming me out."
"Is... 'totally bogus' your thing?"
"So, when you got dressed this morning, was this the look you were going for?"
"There's this thing called grooming. You should try it."
"Hey, I'm right here. So, can you be less uptight and lame now?"
"I ain't gonna' kill you. She is!"
"Nice to unmeet you."
"Kiss me, honey."
"Why now?"
"Give them a pretty last image."
"So, just tiger stuff? Buddy, you've got to mix it up."
"I know you're Vastaya, but your tribe... lacks style!"
"So, you just... run around in the jungle, huh? I mean, I'm not judging, if that's what you're into. Nerd."
"I think we're supposed to laugh, now?"
"At what?"
"Smile and nod, honey."
"Can we leave now?"
"Do you want to smell it?  Not for you! "
"You want to smell it?  No flower for you! "
"Let's get it!"
"I got some moves for you!"
"This is you getting slapped!"
"I'm here to party!"
"Here's what's happening!"
"Damn, this is exciting!"
"I'm gonna' slap all of you!"
"It ain't a party without a fight!"
"What you looking at?"
"Am I not magnificent?"
"Let's dance!"
"Where you going? Where you going?"
"I got one more thing for you!"
"You gonna' feel this one!"
"Be silent and live."
"We will not fade away."
"Time to go to work!"
"Ain't gonna slow me down!"
"Dance or die!"
"Let's get interesting."
"This is the message!"
"You will see my dance!"
"You will see the dance of death."
"This is all so intense!"
"I don't do safe!"
"Woo! You animals are dumb!"
"Yep! I'm amazing!"
"I can't die looking this good!"
"Let's get it started!"
"I got some moves for ya!"
"I need to get in it!"
"Hey! I got a joke for you!"
"I'm right here!"
"Am I not magnificent?"
"I'm gonna' tear this place  up! "
"Oh! I need to get in there!"
"Hey, what did the five fingers say to the face?"
"I feel alright!"
"I'm gonna' hit 'em!"
"I'm incorrigible!"
"You got something to say?"
"They gonna' love this!"
"Hello? You ready for me?"
"Hey, the party's over here!"
"You're gonna' get hurt!"
"Who... wants... to dance?"
"Nothing's fun without risk!"
"You're gonna' love this!"
"What you looking at?"
"Look at me now!"
"I'm gonna' slap all of you!"
"Pay attention! Woo!"
"I like parties with a little violence!"
"They ain't ready! They ain't ready!"
"Challenge accepted!"
"I have killed for her! I will kill for her again."
"Time to get started!"
"Hell, let's do it!"
"Want to see some sweet moves?"
"Look! I'm a distraction!"
"Hey! What you doing?"
"Count it down! One, two, they dead!"
"I'm here! We can get it started!"
"I can be very distracting!"
"Try and hit me, fool!"
"Slap!"
"You like that?"
"My palm sends its regards!"
"How's that face?"
"Get some!"
"Insulted yet?"
"Man, that's insulting!"
"You going to take that from me?"
"Can't stop me!"
"You're welcome!"
"Learn to dance!"
"Yeah!"
"Say yeah!"
"Oh yeah!"
"Watch me!"
"Are you having fun over there?""
"I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!"
"The fight's here!, by me!"
"It's the same fight!"
"You're doing this!"
"Doing it!"
"I hate everyone today!"
"Even me?"
"Not you, baby."
"Should we give them a fighting chance?"
"Only if we want to have fun."
"Who do I hit?"
"One of them!"
"Ah."
"This reminds me of our first dates!"
"Good times!"
"Mind if I cut in, Rakan?"
" Be my guest, miella!"
"That was beautiful, baby!"
"You see that?"
"I couldn't miss it!"
"Make them remember!"
"They'll never forget."
"Let's show 'em what we got."
"Happily."
"You love it when I slap fools?"
"You know I do!"
"This is the plan, right?"
"It is now!"
"What do you want to do later?"
"I can think of something."
"You hungry?"
"Can we talk about this later?"
"But... but... food!"
"You're cute today!"
"Eyes on the prize, baby."
"Let me at 'em!"
"Rakan is very enthusiastic."
"I want to show 'em!"
"I adore your energy."
"Do we need any of these fools?"
"Not a single one."
"Use your words!"
"Can't! Punching!"
"I have your back!"
"I have your back!"
"How long since we last danced?"
"Too long."
"These guys look silly!"
"Bunch of weirdos."
"How many fights we gotta win?"
"All of them!"
"Come on!"
"Come on!"
"Come on!"
"You okay?"
"Better now."
"I got you!"
"Thanks, babe."
"You're welcome."
"Thank you."
"Thank you!"
"Any time!"
"Thank you, honey!"
"That help?"
"Appreciated!"
"Aw, you're looking out for me!"
"Always."
"Party starter!"
"Oh! Yeah!"
"Can't stop me!"
"This is the drop!"
"Come on, fool thought he could match my style?"
"Got a feeling I shouldn't have done that."
"I'm not about killing - but I'll put in the work."
"Whoops. Now you are dead."
"Ugh. Sorry about that."
"Party foul!"
"Step up again, I'll slap you down again."
"Woo! I feel good!"
"Also, your look is played out."
"I got the deadly fresh style!"
"Oh! Can't touch this!"
"The dance is deadly."
"I find this parallel universe stuff very upsetting."
"Well. I always was the pretty one."
"Hello, world! I am single now!"
"I bet she's going to be angry about that later."
"I miss her already. Oh well."
"Your kind started this war. We will end it."
"You put us in a cage? I put you in the ground."
"We don't want your harmony! We want our freedom!"
"I showed you the dance. You should've moved."
"I don't want to like killing, but this time, I did."
"You thought you got away?"
"You came to visit us! Did you think we would forget?"
"I remembered your trespass."
"You were a shadow without a flame."
"Messed with my girl. What did you think I was going to do?"
"He had some style - for a human."
"Punk ass cape."
"Fool thought he could upstage me?"
"Problem with that guy? No talent."
"Another. Dead. Poser."
"Kind of feel bad for the guy. His feathers were weak."
"Punk was trying too hard."
"Power was not meant to be contained. Now, it is free."
"You were given Vastayan blood, yet chose to be blind."
"It is from our blood your gifts came, and my hand that took it back."
"One animal at a time? Weak."
"What was with that girl's dumb purse?"
"Girl thought she could pull out my soul - but I got too much soul!"
"Big girl had too much going on."
"Six legs. Still couldn't dance."
"Was that a land shark? I mean, why? Why is that a thing?"
"Perfect predator? I got an instinct about how stupid that thing was."
"I need to see if people can see how awesome I am!"
"When you open your eyes, you see everything is limitless."
"I need to know when the action's coming."
"Well I don't want to miss the start of the party."
"I dig seeing stuff."
"The world's a big place. Don't want to miss any of it."
"I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to scout around. Pretty, pretty sure."
"I'll just put that there. That's a good place. I hope. Yeah... "
"Let's see what's happening now."
"Yep, if I'm going to see the human world I need to start."
"I'm going to show people some of the strange."
"Peekaboo."
"I am not blind to any possibility."
"I know people are watching. How could they not be?"
"If you look at things the right way, it's awesome."
"The world isn't about collecting stuff, it's about seeing stuff."
"Turn in, turn on, drop out."
"The sleeper must awaken."
"Mankind is blind. I want them to see."
"Vision is the first step towards understanding."
"Aw, crap, I hate having to have a plan."
"I live in the moment."
"I think Xayah told me to improvise. At least, that's the only part of the plan I remember."
"Let's see what these animals can do."
"I... totally forgot why I'm here."
"Our kind will see the truth soon enough."
"I want to feel everything. That's the only way to live."
"Every road leads someplace."
"Hello? Anybody there?"
"Rakan, doing his job."
"I should totally get paid for this."
"That's my baby."
"Ah, it was nothing."
"Did I do that?"
"No. That was me."
"Who's counting?"
"Me. I'm counting."
"Miella, I helped, right?"
"Couldn't have done it without you, mieli."
"Every time you do that, it drives me crazy."
"Well. I'll have to do it more often, then."
"Were... they trying?"
"Probably, but there are two of us."
"I love watching you kill."
"I love killing for you."
"Let's make out."
"Haha! Told you!"
"Rakan, let's not gloat. Much."
"Did they deserve it?"
"They deserved it."
"Why do they break so easily?"
"They aren't made like us."
"Pity."
"That was a Vastayan farewell."
"Isn't a Vastayan farewell when you say, "ouulavaash?"
"I was trying to have a moment, Rakan."
"Did you see that? Haha! That was amazing!"
"Nice job, babe."
"They couldn't keep up with you."
"Only you can, Rakan."
"Babe! Get 'em!"
"Babe! Get 'em!"
"You got it!"
"You got it!"
"Deal with them!"
"Deal with them!"
"You want it?"
"You want it?"
"Take 'em down!"
"Take 'em down!"
"That one!"
"That one!"
"Rakan, slap this fool for me!"
"Rakan, slap this fool for me!"
"Get my back."
"Get my back."
"I need help!"
"I need help!"
"Things are getting ugly."
"Things are getting ugly."
"Yo! Little help!"
"Yo! Little help!"
"I can't do this alone."
"I can't do this alone."
"Babe, watch out."
"Babe, watch out."
"Watch out."
"Watch out."
"Stay sharp."
"Stay sharp."
"Eyes up."
"Eyes up."
"Bad thing."
"Bad thing."
"Hang back."
"Hang back."
"Hang back."
"Hang back."
"Danger!"
"Danger!"
"Look alive."
"Look alive."
"Look alive."
"Look alive."
"Stay alert!"
"Stay alert!"
"They're gone."
"They're gone."
"They vanished."
"They vanished."
"Lost visual."
"Lost visual."
"Enemy missing."
"Enemy missing."
"Enemy missing."
"Enemy missing."
"I don't see them."
"I don't see them."
"Can't find them."
"Can't find them."
"Bringing the pain."
"Bringing the pain."
"On my way."
"On my way."
"On my way."
"On my way."
"Stay alive."
"Stay alive."
"Here I come!"
"Here I come!"
"Here I come!"
"Here I come!"
"On it."
"On it."
"On my way!"
"En route."
"En route."
"Headed to ya."
"Headed to ya."
"Keep it together!"
"Keep it together!"
"I'm on the move."
"I'm on the move."
"I'm on the move."
"I'm on the move."
"Let's go! Baby! Baby? Baby? Baby!"
"Want to catch a ride?"
"You got to keep up, baby!"
"Better hurry up!"
"Rakan out."
"Coming?"
"Damn... "
"Not like this... "
"Open... casket... "
"Well, I tried being good! But evil just brings out the sparkle in my eyes."
"Riku, how can you be tired already? We just got here!"
"What was the plan again? Oh yeah! Destroy hope, bring the second coming of darkness, and get some new hair gel. I'm almost out."
"Stick to the plan” "I thought you said we didn't have one?” "We have a plan, and it's evil and awesome!” "Whatever you say, babe!” “Ugh, I hate the forces of good.” "I know what'll cheer you up...” "Murdering the Star Guardians!” “Hey! I have an evil plan!” "You're sure it's an evil plan?” “Yeah! Riku and I'll just make it up as we go along!” “That doesn't sound very evil.” “You sure this is a good idea?” “We have no choice.” “Don't get killed again.” “Like you can talk.” “Zoe's plans never go wrong!” “They always go wrong” “Its the Star Guardians' fault! The plans...work.” “Really?” “We might have to improvise.” “Good thing you got me, babe!” "Good guys? Ha! How quaint! I just learned that word. I like it."
"Yeah. The Star Guardians looked a whole lot better when I was on the team."
"Get ready to shine, Riku. We're gonna knock out some starlights."
"Woo! Being bad just feels so good!"
"Perfection doesn't exist. Except for my hair. Ooh, and Xayah."
"Doing the right thing was boring. I'm way more fun now."
"Living the dream... The dream of darkness."
"I only believe in myself. Ooh, and Xayah."
"Dancing between the rules!"
"Safe is for nerds. I do danger."
"I loooove evil. And evil loves me."
"Most good guys are just kidding themselves."
"I don't apologise for doin' my thing."
"World's gonna burn. And I look amazing by firelight."
"Hoo! Darkness is the new hotness!"
"Self control is for star nerds. I choose fun!"
"Life is way more fun when you give up the rules."
"Used to be a square. Then, I embraced the darkness. Woohoo!"
"I do what I want. No Star Guardian can say the same."
"Life sucks without Xayah. But it is less complicated."
"The universe tends towards chaos. I'm just helping it along."
"I am bad because I'm free. And I am free because I'm bad!"
"I dance to the beat... The beat called darkness."
"Hoohoo! I feel a fight comin'."
"Safety is boring, Riku. Let's start a fight!"
"Riku! I did not rescue you from a cold dead planet so that you could laugh at me! I rescued you so you could hold my mirror and tell me I look good!"
"Stars are just sad, lonely lightbulbs floating in space revolving endlessly in a cycle they can't control... Anyone have chocolate? I'm craving chocolate."
"Woo! Danger brings out my bad side. Just kidding. All my sides are equally breathtaking."
"How do the Star Guardians see anything? Their sparkles are so darn... Sparkly!"
"This place'll look different when we're in charge, Riku. More dark matteR? Dark matter everywhere! As far as the eye can see!"
"Ooh, Riku! Let's destroy everything they hold dear and then laugh in their faces!"
"It's not that I completely lost my sense of hope. It's that the light inside my died a long time ago leaving a dark, very good-looking soul."
"My cloak is woven from the whispers of starfields, the secrets of galaxies, the wind of the seventh moon. Ooh, and it swishes. Swish, swish!"
*Rakan sneezes* "Hoo. Whoa! I saw stars for a second. Uhh.... Some dark, very evil-looking stars."
"When Xayah and I were abandoned on a desolate planet I realised something. I don't like being alone. Oh, and spiky space-squids are the worst."
"Woo! I am so far past redemption, I'm in the fun zone! Population: Rakan."
"You'd look better just a little bit dead."
"Yeah, gonna be an easy fight."
"There's a word you remind me of. Oh yeah: Basic."
"Wow! That hair... Really doesn't do you any favours."
"Ah, yes. The spirit of wisdom and harmony. Or was it lies and stupidity?"
"So, you think you're rebellious, Jinx?"
"It's tiny nerd and her pet Pix? How quaint.'Quaint'. What a great word."
"Star Guardians? More like Star Losers... Star Losers."
"With two guns, you're twice as bland, Sarah."
"Neeko! If you distract me with myself one more time..."
"Oh no! A Star Hammer! Ooooooo!"
"What are you gonna do, heal me to death?"
"Control is an illusion, Syndra."
"Xayah, uh, is there a secret plan I'm not aware of? Are you a double agent?"
"Bet you wish you hadn't taught me how to play with dark matter, huh, Zoe?"
"Are we gonna fight, or are you just gonna braid each other's hair now?"
"Ugh. So every day is leg day, huh?"
"Yeah, show 'em, Riku! Riku? Agh, Riku!"
"Riku's gonna mess you up bad! No, Riku! I said attack them! Them!!!"
"Insults? Haha! Boring. Lemme show you a real slap in the face."
"C'mon, Riku. Truce? *Riku chittering* Ugh, never mind!"
"Riku. I got your favourite star-shaped treats. *Riku chittering* Ahh, not the hair! Not the hair!"
"Hahahaha! Oh, I was just laughing at how bad your joke was."
"I look good. Cosmically good!"
"You ain't ready for this darkness!"
"Embrace the crazy!"
"Enjoy your life, while it lasts!"
"Starshine is for dweebs."
"Take that, nerd."
"This planet's going down!"
"Great day for slapping nerds!"
"My looks kill!"
"Your nerdiness brings out my eyes!"
"Wanna be a star? Fall like one."
"Time to face darkness! And hotness!"
"Can't turn off the dark!"
"Dark matter slap!"
"The universe is a mess. And I like it!"
"Eat space dirt! Woo!"
"Gonna make you see stars."
"Woo! Tearing up the galaxy!"
"This dance floor has one too many fools."
"Don't be such a star baby!"
"Dance with dark matter!"
"Nerd slap!"
"Slap that nerd!"
"Sup, nerd!"
"Gotcha!"
"You do you,, Ahri. It's not really working, but it's all you got."
"All stars burn out, Lux!"
"Oh look, you've come to avenge me. From me!"
"Tryna' slink away, lizard?"
"Aw, Soraka. You gonna save 'em with hugs?"
"Darling, let's work it out! I wasn't flirting!"
"Payback's a real pain, huh, Zoe?"
"Take that, Star Nerd."
"I move like a comet!"
"Evil never looked so hot!"
"Darkness got style!"
"Space travels fast!"
"Ooh, I look good in dark!"
"I embrace you, darkness!"
"C'mon!"
"Supersonic Stars!"
"Eat my galaxy dust!"
"Darkness shines!"
"Woo!"
"Yeah, baby!"
"Now there is a shining star with your name on it. Just kidding. You're dust."
"Evil won? Heh, shocker!"
"My dreams just beat your dreams."
"Hope wins. Psyche! You're dead."
"You and life just weren't meant to be."
"Woo! Killing makes me feel so alive!"
"Yeah! Thought so, nerd!"
"Wow, your plan really failed, huh?"
"Babe, I helped, right?"  "Well, you were certainly there."
"Time to say 'farewell' to those pitiful star losers."
"Oh, you mean like 'Ciao, star nerds!'?"
"Sure, honey. Whatever you like."
"Remember that time I died, Ahri? Where were you again?"
"Well, your cape was nice, Ez. We coulda been feather bros."
"Your wishes are like, so dead."
"You were just making it up as you went along, Jinx? Sad."
"Goodbye, tiny nerd!"
"So much for bein' special, sparkly space nerd."
"Good talk, Sarah. Can I call ya Sarah? Smell ya later, Sarah."
"Sarah always said you were a useless lizard."
"Nailed it! ...'Cause you have a hammer. And you're dead now."
"So long, space goat."
"I almost feel sorry for you, Syndra. Almost. Ooh, is that chocolate?"
"...Maybe she'll forgive me?"
"Never backstab a backstabber, Zoe! It ends ugly."
"Evil's been SOOOO good to me!"
"Gonna go stare in the mirror. It's daily affirmation time, Rakan."
"If you forget my name, just call for the Lord of Darkness, the Prince of Evil, the Emperor of... Hotness."
"Sometimes we agents of darkness need a break. And a chocolate bar."
"Wait! Xayah..."
"Let Xayah... Be safe..."
"Can't kill evil. But you can wear it like a sweet cloak."
"Woo! I am alive!"
"Thanks, Riku! Real cold in there."
"Let's go! Baby! Baby? Baby? Baby!"
"Ha! I'm, G to the D! Golden Diamonds, boy! Woo!"
"Name one genius that ain't crazy."
