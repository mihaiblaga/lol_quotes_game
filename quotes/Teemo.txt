"Captain Teemo on duty."
"Yes, sir!"
"Hut, two, three, four."
"Yes, sir!"
"I'll scout ahead!"
"Armed and ready."
"That's gotta sting."
"Reporting in."
"Swiftly!"
"Never underestimate the power of the Scout's code."
"Size doesn't mean everything."
"There's a mushroom out there with your name on it."
"Survive here a week, then you get a name."
"The war never ends, the battlefield just changes."
"I've done things I'm not proud of."
"I'm the last scout standing."
"You don't know about war."
"You'd be surprised how quick fur ignites."
"My ears are always ringing."
"One day there'll be a reckoning."
"War didn't change me, I changed war!"
"Tall folk don't last long round here."
"Never. Get. Attached."
"Good men die. I choose to live."
"We ain't all makin' it out of here."
"Peace is a fairy tale."
"Reinforcements ain't comin'."
"Size is a liability."
"Nobody's innocent any more."
"I used to live by a code."
"They been looking for yours truly."
"Survival ain't pretty."
"Lots to do before I punch out."
"A part of you never leaves the jungle."
"I forget what started the fighting..."
"You can't tell but, uh, I've grown quite the beard under here."
"You want Teemo? Come and get him!"
"Take a long walk through the jungle!"
"My tears have all dried up, kid."
"You've got no idea what it's like on the ground, flyboy!"
"Little guy's gone native."
"Wars are won with men, not machines."
"Rockets ain't for jumping. Who gave you that?"
"Everyone's on a clock, but only mine keeps ticking."
"Here you go, little guy. You're my only friend left."
"You and I are survivors, buddy. They can never kill us."
"They won't make the mistake of thinking you're harmless again."
"We'll make them pay for what they did to your family little guy."
"Take the pain!"
"Natural-born killer."
"Turns out, I got a proficiency in killing."
"Let the poison do its work."
"Death has a name."
"This is where we draw the line."
"I settle my scores."
"This'll be messy."
"Time for the long nap."
"Sight. Shoot. Reload."
"I don't feel anything."
"Who's my next tally mark?"
"Look alive."
"This is  very  personal."
"Smell that? That's fear."
"Killing's all I'm good at."
"I'm taking everyone with me!"
"This one's for Johnny!"
"This one's for my helmet brother!"
"Become one with the jungle."
"Now, we wait."
"Patience now."
"Blind 'em!"
"Bug out!"
"Hut two three four!"
"Move!"
"Swiftly!"
"Face toward enemy."
"Got a little surprise for 'em."
"I own this land."
"Another mushroom, another victim."
"Watch your step."
"More where that came from."
"Armed and ready."
"Teemo'd."
"I'm everywhere."
"You're welcome."
"Got teeth? You got a weapon."
"We all live in the jaws of the beast."
"Next time I see Nashor, I'll yank a couple more."
"Some masks you never take off."
"Let 'em die slow."
"This is gonna sting."
"Time to put on my killin' hat."
"Mete out the pain."
"Fighting fair is a good way to die."
"There's no such thing as collateral damage."
"One on three? Best odds yet."
"This coulda saved a lot of good men."
"Two and a half seconds is all it takes."
"Sometimes, time stands still, and all you can do is watch."
"I know everything that happens here."
"Nobody gets past Teemo."
"Never let your guard down."
"Coming in hot!"
"Need to get patched up!"
"There's nothing left here."
