"Now, hear the silence of annihilation!"
"Let me end this!"
"Pantheon, I see you! Like a lamprey you attach yourself to a host! I will carve you from this mortal's form, and eviscerate you both!"
"Pantheon! I will crush your godhood, I will eviscerate your ideals, even your memory... I will trample!"
"Targon sends an aspect against me? Prepare yourself, Pantheon, I will end all that you hope to be!"
"They think me defeated, enchained. But I am unbowed... Noble is this carnage."
"I am your reckoner, mortals."
"Challenge me, mortals! I am here!"
"Am I the abyss? Or did I gaze into it?"
"The only peace I seek... is death!"
"I am oblivion, I am destruction... I am doom."
"The true sound of my blade can only be heard when they loathe re-incarnation."
"This cursed form... This crude decaying flesh! I loathe it!"
*Laughs* "Let them lament... my name."
"I stood against the void. Now... I would welcome it."
"I cannot die... until all life ends."
"Primitives worship me, hoping for mercy. I shall give them death."
"They will call me a god killer!"
"I am doom!"
"As long as this form lives, I will punish them."
"My suffering... I will make it bloom."
"My darkness was not born, it was forged by my prison."
"I am not a king, I am not a god, I am... worse..."
"Those who call me enemy, I welcome them."
"I will snuff out the light, I shall make darkness eternal!"
"All that lives, I will end!"
"There is a darkness in my heart deeper than any shadow!"
"I march to death... Though I wish it was my own..."
"I will drown them in oceans of blood!"
"Patience, Aatrox! Patience! Your freedom will come!"
"Gods and mortals, they deserve only death!"
"Kneel mortals! So I may split your shoulders from your spine!"
"March toward vengeance... Drown this world in blood!"
"I must destroy even hope."
"For my imprisonment, they will suffer!"
"I will render these mortals' forms into my own!"
"Their screams will be like the soothing hum of insects at dusk."
"They will call me villain... Come, let me earn their hatred, again and forever."
"We had another name once... Now, we are Darkin."
"I am ready to be the World-Ender!"
"I am Aatrox, I am the World-Ender!"
"Carnage, hate, yes! I am the World-Ender!"
"Take everything from them! Become the World-Ender!"
"Insects, the World-Ender has come!"
"This is the time, the World-Ender is here!
"Death to all! The World-Ender awaits!"
"See your World-Ender!"
"Bow worms! Bow before the World-Ender!"
"Behold, the World-Ender!"
"I bring silence! I am the World-Ender!"
"Quiet yourselves, the World-Ender is here!"
"There is no escape from the World-Ender!"
"Now, I am the World-Ender!"
"Tricked into this existence... False slave entrapped by endless life! I shall become a beast feeding on their destruction, and making them lament my unholy birth!"
"I have no goodness left, it was taken from me, stolen! I... am the nemesis of life."
"They sing of love, hope and gods, all that makes them want to live! So, I will quiet that first!"
"I shall take their limbs. I will reap their beloved! I will tear from their consciousness, the will to live. Yes, this is my purpose."
"Cleave through them, Aatrox! Crush their skulls! Shatter their ribs! Disembowl their very souls!" *Heavy breathing* "Our vengeance is at hand!"
"Every dream is a candle I must snuff out... I... am the darkness..."
"The heavens, the endless skies folding into each other. Where are they now?"
"How far I have fallen! A god... reduced to a prisoner!"
"Once in noble battle, I screamed against the silence. I stood as light against the darkness. Now, I serve a new master... oblivion..."
"See what beasts they have reduced us to... Creatures of flesh sustained only by this filth's blood and form!"
"From entire villages and towns, I will rend the flesh... Until I stand... as an unholy god."
"March flesh, march toward them! We have horrors to sow! Lives to reap! Let me make them regret... being free."
"Dark deeds I will do this day... Though I will carry myself as my former pride dictates!"
"Where I was excellence, I am deformed... Recast poorly with these crude materials. But this abomination of flesh well serves my murderous intent."
"I shall 
not
 kiss the ground, nor let myself be wielded as a tool! I am 
damned
, but I will remake this world in 
my
 dark image!"
"Let me tear their flesh from them. Let me break their souls... And murder their dreams."
"I am but an unholy copy of life... A mockery of its freedom... And born in the cruel betrayal of the noble ideals I would've served."
"I touched the stars, and saw the glorious light of a thousand suns! Now, blinded by this elegance, how could my purpose be anything... but dark..."
"I beg, let some challenge me today... So that I may tear out their hearts! Pray! Let me watch them die, eyes knowing they served... my dark purpose..."
"No beast so fierce, but knows some touch of pity... But I know none... and therefore am no beast." *Laughs*
"To war, Aatrox! They shall not rob us of our nobility! We shall stand, and spit venom at our tormentors for eternity!"
"I do not obey! I cannot lay down! I will be the ender of all things!"
"We march to battle... Let me carve flesh, let me cloak myself in the slaughter! Hide me in their carnage... Hide me from this suffering..."
"I shall regard their cries as braying steeds, waiting to be whipped, broken, and bridled!"
"I am in a cage within a prison... But this 
foul
 shape reminds me of my purpose!"
"Do you see my edge?! Your death awaits!"
"Pray, fool! You face a Darkin."
"This violence shall amuse!"
"Our duel begins."
"Come closer! I will show you... darkness!"
"Come, fight me!"
"Tricks, Akali? They will not hide you from me, face your doom."
"Another foolish god, even the phoenix shall end."
"Scissors for legs... Okay, I thought I had seen stupid designs before... Alright, let's go."
"Look at your noble courage, Darius! Now learn... despair."
"You are unloved, Mundo! Now, face judgement!"
"I know your name, Fiora. This is not a duel you shall win."
"A statue? Rock shatters as easily as bone! Come!"
"Guns and oranges? Are you a clich√© or a joke? Come! Fight! Die!"
"Scream 'Demacia', Garen! Scream its name before I crush you, 
and
 it!"
"I kill gods, priestess. Let us continue this fight... until all things stop!"
"A worthy vessel! Come, Jax!"
"You would rush towards me, Kai'Sa? What fool would build a strategy on that idea? Come, let us begin."
"Let me show you your error, Kayle! You are not worthy of ascension! You, are not worthy of the worms!"
"Ooh, a shadow warrior! How edgy!"
"I did not think my fellows weak, Rhaast! Already you disappoint me!"
"A lightning squirrel?" *Laughs* "Thank you! Your death will amuse me!"
"Are you a joke, you loud, horrible thing? I shall kill you 
and
 your steed!"
"Where is your head, rock thing? Where is the neck I shall sever?"
"Am I challenged by a tree?! Fine, let me build a pyre from you!"
"You would bind yourself to this realm. Morgana? Fine, let me show you the ground!"
"Nasus, is your wisdom enough to know your fate? I am your death!"
"Your noble purpose amuses me, Nautilus! Fight me, see true death!"
"Hail father Ornn, god of fire and forge!" *Laughs* "I am Aatrox, and I am the god killer!"
"Hail Pantheon! Let me hear you cry of friendship! Let me hear you scream of brotherhood!"
"Hail Pantheon! See the weapon I have become! Watch as 
you
 are destroyed!"
"Hail Pantheon! How noble and proud he carries himself! Come betrayer! Come 
fiend
!"
"A bird? You would challenge me with a bird?!" *Laughs* "Come!"
"Renekton! In your madness, you know my suffering! Though I shall end yours."
"Riven, dance, child! That broken blade is no match for me!"
"You would challenge me in a machine? You are a strange spirit, Rumble."
"A spirit blade, master Shen? Test it agaist me, let 
me
 shatter your illusions!"
"Yes Sion! I kill even that which will not die! I end all things!"
"Hail the protector! Hail Taric, aspect of- get a haircut!"
"Cowardly spirit, how annoying you are! I will savour killing you, Teemo!"
"A troll king?! Come! Defend your throne, king of trolls!"
*Laughs* "Yes, Tryndamere! I am the cause of your suffering! See if you can cut justice from me!"
"I wait for you, Tryndamere! Come, take your vengeance!"
"Remember the screams of your kinsmen as you fall to me, Tryndamere!"
"Rage? You are just flesh, Tryndamere, ready for harvesting!"
"You would end worlds? As a bow?!"
"I will not send you to death, Yorick! I bring oblivion!"
"I know it was you, trickster! You gave them the tools to trap me! Come, let me kill you! A thousand times isn't enough!"
"My will... is beyond death!"
"I am Darkin! I do not die!"
"Behold, immortality!"
"A scythe? A scythe?! Are you planning on murdering fields of wheat?!"
"I chose a sword, the noblest weapon, Rhaast. You- seriously I don't understand... Were you trapped in the gardening section?"
"We all agreed on the double 'A' thing, Varus. The double 'A' thing!"
"Varus, 'V' 'A' 'R' 'U' 'S', your name should have an 'A' and then another 'A', Varus. There was a memo, Varus, there was a memo!"
"I will find a way to tear down the heavens and reveal you as fiends! Not today obviously..."
"Do I resemble you, abomination? Your form isn't my destiny... is it? You don't know how to talk, do you? Shit..."
"I am like a demon, but more edgy, right? You know, cause I'm a sword. Hmm..."
"So uh, I'm Aatrox. I'm a transcendental being trapped inside cutlery... What's your deal?"
"Uh, nice world you have here. I intend to destroy it, you know, 
FYI
."
Aatrox laughs

"Come, let me show you darkness!"
"Fight! Join me in death!"
"Your death awaits!"
"I will hack and chop and cleave, and sunder the filth of your forms!"
"I am not 
your
 enemy, I am 
the
 enemy!"
"I am Darkin! Your gods fear me!"
"I will sever your limbs! I will carve your souls!"
"Carnage is my method."
"I can smile, and murder while I smile."
"Suffer, as I suffer!"
"Carnage... Hoooooome..."
"Hear this cursed form sing!"
"Sorrow... I shall deliver it to you."
"I begged for death, now I am its bringer!"
"I am the god killer!"
"Come!" *Grunt* "Destiny awaits!"
"You would fight me?! Come, let me show you hell!"
"Your annihilation beckons!"
"Violence... distracts me from these chains!"
Aatrox snarls.
Aatrox roars.
"I come for you, Pantheon."
"The power of an aspect, wasted on a fool!"
"I killed your tribe. Now, join them!"
"Tryndamere! This is your destiny!"
"I will gut you, and tear you from existence, trickster!"
"Aspect of change! Now 
you
 die!"
Aatrox yells.
Aatrox yells.
Aatrox yells.

Aatrox grunts.

"Fight! Or be forgotten!"
"Become... hate!"
"I offer you victory!"
"Let blood be our sacrament!"
"Follow me into destruction!"
Aatrox roars.
Aatrox roars.
Aatrox roars.
"Fight! Or be forgotten!"
"Become... hate!"
"I offer you victory!"
"Let blood be our sacrament!"
"Follow me into destruction!"
"This is your absolution."
"To the end of times, I shall kill you again and again."
"This was reckoning."
"You die... a fool."
"I brought you the one true gift, I brought you... death!"
"Your broken form speaks only of failure."
"Carnage, my last joy."
"This is the silence I seek."
"I will have silence."
"Resurrect! Return! So I may kill you again..."
"This is my gift to mortals."
"I sing only in your deaths."
"I do not need to show my mastery, it is self-evident."
"Resurrection, an endless cycle of life... A dead bird."
"What foolish plan bore a woman such as you, Camille? You were a folly, crafted by an idiot."
"The axe suited you, Darius, the weapon of a simpleton!"
"I expected you to be nimble, Fiora. Too easily, my blade crushed your spine."
"Yo ho, Gangplank, yo ho."
"Demacia!" *Laughs* "Whatever 'Demacia' is, I will slay it next!"
"In time I will learn how to kill even your god, Illaoi!"
"I cannot know if I was corrupted by the void, but at least my choices were not asinine."
"Die, Kayle, knowing your potential will never be reached."
"I cannot have brotherhood with incompetence."
"What is property? Why did this dead hamster want me off of it?"
"I kill mountains, Malphite! Dumb piles of rocks!"
"Hear me, tree spirit. Your form is but kindling, and your forests I will burn!"
"You disgust me, Morgana. Die in the filth of your bound flesh!"
"Yes, Shurima was meant to fall, Nasus, as were you!"
"Journey back to the deep!"
"Ornn, like all gods, you disappoint!"
"Pantheon, you crawl forward like a worm! Ready to be squashed again?"
"Now your body matches your blade, Riven: broken and worthless!"
"Die, Shen, knowing the Eye of the Twilight is blinded and plucked."
"You fought to live, Sion, yet it is I who am still alive. This at least amuses."
"Lord of starlight, lord of hair! I trample on your corpse, Taric! I spit on your aspect's purpose!"
"A spirit for cowards, I laugh at your tricks and mushrooms!"
"I thought you my next vessel, Tryndamere. Pity, you failed even to become a slave."
"Return again to your prison, Varus. Think upon your worthlessness!"
"Honestly, a bow and two boys? What was your plan, Varus?"
"How I loathe your freedom, trickster! I will take this vengeance upon you, until the end of times!"
"Mastery? I must congratulate you, obviously your parents never had reason to."
"Yes, your mastery is the master of masters! I am fighting... an imbecile..."
"Somehow, I doubt you've mastered self-esteem."
"Mastery, how I idolise your greatness! Though I suspect your weapon lacks... impact."
"Ah, mastery, well done! Now master your insignificance."
"Insects, you think you can kill me? Behold my curse!"
"You cannot destroy me!"
"I 
do not
 die!"
*Grunt* "Nothing can kill me!"
"I return!"
*Laughs* "Yes! Fight me!"
"I... am 
not
 a mortal!"
"Did you think you could kill 
me
?!"
"You think you can kill me?"
"As long as life exists, as long as time has meaning, I am not done!"

Aatrox groans.

"Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows... "
"Peace is a lie, there is only passion... "
"Pain is temporary, pride is forever"
"You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"
"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."
