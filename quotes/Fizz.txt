"Let me at 'em!"
"To the briny deep."
"I'm ready."
"Swimmingly."
"C'mon, let's go!"
"Wanna see a trick?"
"No fear!"
"One jump ahead of you."
"They won't catch me."
"In a splash."
"Land, ho!"
"You're boring."
"Not interested."
"Hmm, something's fishy."
"Fish, fish fish!"
"The tide turns."
"The mighty shark stalks his prey."
"Now we strike."
"To the briny deep."
"I'll show them a watery grave."
"Shark!"
"Lunch time!"
"Feeding time!"
