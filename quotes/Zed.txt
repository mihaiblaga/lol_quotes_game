"The unseen blade is the deadliest."
"Do not, deny me."
"Without a sound."
"No technique is forbidden."
"Brave the shadows, find the truth."
"Do not fear the shrouded path."
"Balance is a fool's master."
"Secrets kept are weapons wasted."
"The shadows have enlightened me."
"Balance is weakness."
"The truth lies in darkness."
"Tradition is the corpse of wisdom."
"What I have done... cannot be undone."
"Embrace the shadow... or die in darkness!"
"The merest shade of me... is enough to defeat you!"
"Challenge me, Shen... you shall not be an orphan long!"
Zed plays 'rock, paper, scissors' with his shadow. If he wins, his shadow bows and disappears. If he loses, he kills his shadow.
"Forbidden shadow wins."

"The shadow is within."
"Punish restraint."

"None escape their shadow."

"We are life perfected."
"What we have seen... what we have done... you are all part of it."
"We will cure the galaxy of conflict. We will cure the galaxy of ignorance."
"We once bowed before the Templars. Now, we are the truth they deny."
"Someone here likes Ora. Shall we demonstrate its power?"
"Our enemy came all this way to face us? And they say we try too hard."
"Simple life forms surround us."
"The unknown is here."
"We will show the universe its true potential."
"Tradition pacifies the weak."
"The Templars restrain us no more."
"Ora... the essence of all things."
"Some consider us evil... How naive they must be."
"Let us remind the universe what we are."
"Remorse is futile."
"If they want ora... we will give it."
"Our blades crave battle."
"No more sacred orders. No more limitations."
"Harmony blooms once the weak wither away."
"Listen to the cosmos. Hear the truth."
"The galaxy will know its destiny."
"We. Are. Enlightened."
"Beyond the reaches of space we evolve."
"Only fools cling to morals."
"We are the gift this galaxy needs."
"Behold! The pinnacle of creation."
"We are everywhere all at once."
"A new genesis approaches."
"Only time can judge us."
"We walk the path to eternity."
"The Templars promise salvation. They lie."
"We let the monster out."
"We gaze upon the stars and see no limits."
"We go where others dare not."
"The weak crave the illusion of balance. The worthy enforce true harmony."
"Someone must destroy the weak. Let it be us."
"So many try to hide their worst fears. And yet, we walk free."
"The galaxy... a vast expanse infested by the weak."
"How we long for something simpler. Harmony..."
"Templars, Demaxians, The Syndicate, all blind fools."
"There is only triumph and we will claim it all."
"They see us as a living weapon. We are more than that. We are life transcended!"
"These creatures waste their ora. Let us pluck it out!"
"We grow ever stronger under the living stars."
"Acquire forbidden power. Defy sacred doctrine. This is just the beginning."
"The Demaxians conquer planets. We enlighten galaxies."
"The Templars say our deeds are extreme. They are right."
"Do not challenge us. We extend beyond your understanding."
"Humanity achieves so little. Grant them ora and still they wallow in mediocrity."
"Before us, there was nothing. Before nothing, there were monsters."
"When life grows unchecked, cleansing blades are needed."
"They mistake evolution for corruption. That is why they will fall."
"This pain urges us to kill you though we do not know why."
"You intend to destroy us. A grave mistake."
"What are you!?"
"Worthy spirit, Jinx. But it cannot save you... from us."
"In another life, Kayn, you might have been a half-decent pupil."
"Malphite, we heard you were hard to kill. Challenge accepted."
"Sona, we both know the Templars lie. Join us!"
"Captain Yasuo. This is your crew? Your brother would be so disappointed..."
"Tell us, Ziggs. Do space rats go to Heaven?"
"We offer you a choice: Die now, or die later."
"You are dust. We are perfection."
"You will love the way you die. We guarantee it."
"We pray you fight better than you talk."
"Cooking is like killing. It takes skill and ours is unmatched."
"Have you come to dine with us? Oh, wait... of course. You are us."
"Look at us! Are we not the perfect reflection of your juvenile fantasies?"
"Your jokes. They lack humor."

"Witness our superior form."
"Silence your thoughts."
"The cosmos demands better."
"We bring extinction."
"You do not deserve life."
"All will fear us."
"Eradicate the weak."
"You will not deny us."
"Disharmony..."
"None shall escape."
"Your ora needs release."
"No room for the weak."
"Pathetic life form."
"You coward."
"Your time is over."
"Cut to pieces."
"Weak!"
"Sever."
"Let's end your existence."
"Lowly creature."
"Craven fool!"
"Your body will break."
"All life ends."
"Our blades cry out."
"How frail you are."
"Have the decency to die."
"You earned oblivion."
"Pathetic scum."
"No mercy"
"That arm looks heavy, Jinx. Let's cut it off."
"Kayn! Our first and final lesson begins."
"Blades beat fists Malphite."
"Sona! You disappoint us."
"Are you worthy of that title 'captain'?"
"Ready to be disgraced again Ziggs?"

"We. Are. Zed."
"It's over."
"You're already dead."
"Look at the skill. Look at the moves. Zed, what was that!?"
"So fragile. So weak."
"Even your best falls short."
"Life, at a price."
"Embrace your destiny."
"Survival of the fittest."
"What was that filth?"
"Is your entire species this brittle?"
"Are you humbled? You should be."
"We almost miss your voice, Jinx. It had a certain... loud quality."
"Not good enough, Kayn."
"Not even close, Malphite."
"We thought you knew better, Sona."
"No cure for foolish captains."
"Confirmed. Space rats do not go to Heaven."
"We are life. We are evolution. We. Are. Zed."
"One by one they all fall down."
"Consider this our gift."
"A moment of peace... before our victory."
"You all may live... until we return."
"We go... to collect untold power."

"Nothing can bury us."
"Not even death can contain us."
"We do not regret."
