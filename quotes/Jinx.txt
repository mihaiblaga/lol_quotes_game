"Rules are made to be broken... like buildings! Or people!"
"Aww, c'mon, what's the worst that could happen?"
"Let's just behave... said no one, ever."
"Wait, I'm 
thinking
! Urgh... how do people do this?"
"I'm trying to care but I just can't!"
"Jinx? Stands for Jinx! Durr."
"Whatever, let's just start shooting!"
"Now where was I? Oh, right, wreaking havoc!"
"Hold on! I'm about to say something really cool!"
"Ask me if I'm listening! Hint: I'm not!"
"I don't even think once about blowing stuff up!"
"She's such a loser, always ready to cry!' T-t-t-ta!"
"You think I'm crazy? You should see my 
 
sister
!"
"I have the best intentions!"
"I'm wearing lots of belts! For no reason at all."
"Bullets!"
"Who needs reasons?"
"I'm crazy! Got a doctor's note."
"All part of the plan I just made up!"
"What if I had a gun that... shot other guns?"
"Aww, c'mon, what's the worst that could happen?"
"I really need a new gun. But don't tell my other guns."
"What's in my violin case? Violence."
"Guns don't kill people. I mean, until you shoot them. Then they kill everything!"
"I'm bringing guns to the knife fight! Hehe."
"Say hello to my friends of varying sizes!"
"Three guns means never having to say 'I'm sorry'."
"Welcome to Snoresville, hat lady! Population: you."
"But where are your other guns, hat lady?"
"You're gonna chase me, fat hands?"
"Vi? Stands for stupid!"
"I'm over here, fat hands!"
Jinx pulls out 
 
Fishbones
 and mimics talking with him like a puppet.
"Hey Fishbones, should we blow something up? 'You might inconvenience people and hurt their feelings.' You're the worst weapon ever!"
"Fishbones, you know what we oughta' do? 'Do the laundry, wash dishes and pay some bills.' Stupid dumb rocket launcher."
"Hey Fishbones, think we can wreak havoc forever? 'No, you should buy a home and save for retirement.' You know I can replace you, right?"
"Maybe we should settle down and live peaceful lives. 'Really? I always hoped one day you'd---' Haha, nope! You're a death machine for life!"
Jinx falls to the ground and starts giggling hysterically.
Jinx laughs.
Jinx laughs.
Jinx laughs.
Jinx laughs.
Jinx dances next to a gramophone playing 'Get Jinxed'.
"Stay still! I'm trying to shoot you!"
"I'll give you to the count of - time's up!"
"Duck! Hehe, just kidding, that won't help."
"Gotta' die sometime!"
"Smile! It's called gun 
play
."
"Any last words? Ha! No, just die."
"Seriously, screaming helps... not at all."
"No need to be scared - or alive."
"You're starting to bore me."
"I accidentally did that on purpose."
"You're my favorite waste of bullets."
"You're not laughing."
"Tcha-tcha-tcha-tcha!"
"Katchoo!"
"Everybody, panic!"
"I feel like I forgot to shoot something... "
"Scream along if you know the words!"
"I've got a recital, and everyone's invited!"
"Who wants a solo?"
"Zap!"
"Drink up!"
"Pop the cork!"
"See ya!"
"Bye bye!"
"Watch this!"
"Catch!"
"Three, forty-one, nine and 
lift off
!"
"I'll be right back! No one die screaming without me!"
"They... got me... "
"Awww... "
"That really hurt... my feelings."
"That was almost not close at all!"
A stripped-down version of "Burning Bright" plays.
"Slogan, catchphrase, tagline!"
"To infinity and - uh, oops. Wrong catchphrase!"
"You're not dreaming - I'm a Star Guardian now."
"Here comes a rising star."
"Let's get the sparkle party started."
"How do you like my extreme makeover?"
"Armed and dangerous - with sparkles."
"Protecting the universe, one bullet at a time!"
"Can you believe I was 
chosen
 for this?"
"Don't let the sparkles fool you."
"Being noble takes all the fun out of fighting."
"What do you think? Mercy, or mayhem?"
"What, your guns don't talk to you?"
"I'm fighting for peace, and justice and... er... eh, whatever."
"Jury's still out on this whole Star Guardian thing."
"This is not my idea of magical."
"Hate to be ruthless but - oh, wait, no I don't!"
"Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind."
"Glory to the First Star... whatever that means."
"Star Guardian to the rescue! Am I doing it right?"
"Onward to glitter and glory!"
"We're on a mission! Just... don't remember what."
"What's next? Is it shooting? I love shooting."
"Who's up for a round of Hide and Go Shoot?"
"Yeah, I got this Star Guardian thing down."
"Does First Star have to deal with this many sparkles?"
"Warning! My guns are getting restless."
"Look at me! Pandemonium with a purpose."
"Ugh... why do Star Guardians have to play 'nice'?"
"Glitter and guns - now that's a winning combo."
"Shiro and Kuro are ready for action."
"First Star says this is all part of the plan."
"Aw, did I hurt your feelings?"
"Believe in yourself - not that it'll help."
"You're so cute when you're losing."
"I've got a fistful of glitter with your name on it!"
"Ready to get glitter bombed?"
"Not scared of my sparkles? You should be."
"Got to say, I don't miss my old guns at all."
"Wait. I look like 
that
?"
"Is it me, or is Janna getting way too old for this?"
"Hey, Janna! You might want to look into a retirement plan."
"When First Star talks to you, something's lost in translation."
"Do your thing, Lulu... whatever that is."
"You can learn a lot from Lulu. Just not sure what."
"Quit while you're ahead, Lulu. Oh, wait, that's never."
"Loosen up, Lux. Fighting evil's supposed to be fun."
"Lux even makes boring beautiful."
"I'm positive this will hurt."
"Only Lux could make battle so boring."
"You take this Guardian thing way too seriously."
"Chill out, Poppy. Leave some for the rest of us."
"Watch out, Poppy's off to save the world again."
"Got a present for you, Poppy. It's called defeat."
"Looks like you're getting rusty."
"I AM A MECH. I AM PROGRAMMED TO LOSE."
"Hey, mech! The only good robot is a deactivated robot!"
"Guardians rule, PROJECT drools!"
"PROJECT? Ha! More like 
reject
."
"All those PROJECT enhancements and you're still pathetic."
"Let's bring a little starlight into the Void."
"Wait, does Void refer to your home, or your head?"
"Ugh, is everything in the Void this ugly?"
"Hey, Hat Lady! Say hello to the new me."
"Poor Vi, must be killing you not to punch me."
"Now it's my turn to be the hero, Vi."
"Hey, Vi. I'm a Star Guardian now. Jealous much?"
"Hey, Graves! Have a taste of destiny!"
"So, what's your favourite part about being a Star Guardian?"
Shiro squeaks
"Now, now, Shiro. First Star doesn't like the word slaughter."
"Hey, Shiro, what do you call someone with their head blown off?"
Shiro squeaks
"I don't know either. Let's find out!"
"So, Shiro, what was in the Star Guardian contract I signed?"
Shiro squeaks
"Yeah, TLDR."
"What's your favourite part about being a Star Guardian, Kuro?"
Kuro squeaks
"I had no idea you loved sparkles so much."
"Hey, Kuro, you know what I call five dead enemies?"
Kuro squeaks
"A great start!" (laughs)
"What do you think, Kuro? Is Star Guardian a good look for me?"
Kuro squeaks
"Next time, just lie."
Jinx laughs.
Jinx laughs.
Jinx laughs.
Jinx laughs.
"I'm a shooting star!" (laughs)
"I'll try to make this painless. Honest."
"Oh, no, don't make me break the Guardian code."
"Sorry, it's my duty to destroy you."
"I've got your starlight right here."
"Nothing personal, I'm obligated to trash you."
"I almost feel guilty about this."
"This is the best part of being a Star Guardian!"
"Sorry, First Star made me do this."
"Say hello to my little friends."
"Alright, who's feeling ferocious?"
"Don't be so hard on yourself... I'll do it for you."
"Slaying dragons is not in my job description."
"Star Guardians have better things to destroy than dragons."
"Glitter trumps fire every time."
"Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the cave."
"Ew! Somebody got hit with an ugly stick."
"Hey, Baron, I've seen black holes with more charm."
"Three heads - and not one of them has a brain."
"Hey, Baron, want to give us a... hand?" (laughs)
"Ready to roll?"
"Your turn!"
"Meet Shiro!"
"Yes, Kuro, all my enemies fear you."
"No, Kuro, I'm the Guardian, you're the gun."
"Don't worry, Kuro, your time is coming."
"A Star Guardian's best friend."
"Ready to rock?"
"Unleash the beast!"
"Meet Kuro!"
"Patience, Shiro, First Star claims it's a virtue."
"Don't be jealous, Shiro, I love both my guns."
"Relax, Shiro, I'll save some for you."
"Not so fast!"
"Starlight express!"
"Talk to the hand!"
"Hold up!"
"Finger of doom!"
"I point, you die."
"Watch your step!"
"Stunning, isn't it?"
"My gift to you."
"I have the best toys."
"Double trouble!"
"Better together!"
"Two for one!"
"Double hatter!"
"Combo platter!"
"That was 
stellar!
 Get it? Star Guardian? Stellar?"
"Bam! It's lights out for you!"
"It wasn't me! My guns have minds of their own."
"You'll be missed, Janna!" Jinx laughs. "Not by me."
"Make room for the new kid on the block!"
"So, how did that taste, Lulu?"
"This almost breaks my heart, Lux."
"I killed Poppy!" Jinx laughs. "Who's next?"
"Now that you're dead... can I keep the hat?"
"Sorry, Urgot. It's just a Star Guardian thing."
"Justice never felt so good!"
"It's more fun when they fight back."
"What's wrong with a little carnage?"
"I'm feeling generous. Bullets for everyone!"
"You get a bullet! You get a bullet! Everyone gets a bullet!"
"Star light, star bright, another turret destroyed tonight!"
"Can you say... shopping spree?"
"Can't I have one of everything?"
"Ooh, shiny!"
"I'm kind of a high roller."
"No limit on my first star card."
"Just put this on my Star Guardian tab."
"Who wants to hold the sword?"
"Look, Shiro, a new toy."
"Present for you, Kuro!"
"A guardian for a Guardian!"
"Angels? Whatever!"
"Look, Kuro! Life insurance!"
"Now we're talking, Shiro!"
"Kuro loves edgy."
"Infinitely awesome."
"The only kind of whisper I like."
"Just for you, Kuro."
"Quiet, Shiro, it's a 
whisper.
"
"Can't keep a Star Guardian down."
"Eh, just strap it to my gun."
"Shiro's been asking for this."
"Faster guns? Sold."
"Look, Shiro! Speed boost."
"Hope Kuro's not jealous."
"Eh, it needs starlight... but I'll take it."
"I'd be shocked if Shiro doesn't like this."
"Kuro, look what I've got."
"Who wants the red shield?"
"Look, Kuro, legendary."
"Shiro will 
love
 this."
"Can't get enough of these."
"I'm amazing. Not immortal."
"Bottoms up."
"Sweet. Don't mind if I do."
"Snack time."
"Delicious and nutritious."
"You can't hide from starlight."
"This'll shed some light on things."
"Now I see everything."
"Peekaboo." Jinx laughs.
"I was just getting warmed up!"
"Say goodbye, my little guns!"
"They say parting is such sweet sorrow... they're idiots."
"I'm taking my guns and going home."
"Ugh, I hate this dancing part."
A shortened version of "Burning Bright" plays.
"Don't worry, Lux. You know I'll be back."
"Hey, Lux, do Guardians get lunch breaks?"
"Don't forget... to miss me, Lux... "
"Ugh... whatever... "
"...seriously? That's a bummer... "
"The horror... the horror... ha ha... "
"Oh no. I'm dying."
"Don't... worry... Kuro... we'll be back."
"Relax, Shiro... revenge is sweet."
"The money's... buried in the... "
"Oops, forgot to read my Guardian handbook."
"Back in action! Miss me?"
"You can't keep a Star Guardian down."
"Ugh, enough with the glitter!"
"My guns need to be brushed - or something."
"The worst part about being a Star Guardian - all this glitter."
"Shiro and Kuro have a serious shedding problem."
"What kind of guns like sparkles anyway?"
"Glitter bomb!"
"Seriously, you two need a bath."
"I never realised stardust was so... messy."
"Always wanted to leave a mark... but not so sparkly."
"Spring cleaning!"
"Only as good as your guns."
"Twinkle, twinkle, lethal star!"
"Welcome to Summoner's Rift!"
"Welcome to Summoner's Rift!"
"Welcome to Summoner's Rift!"

"Welcome... to the Howling Abyss."
"Welcome... to the Howling Abyss."
"Welcome to the Howling Abyss."
"Welcome... to the Howling Abyss. So much attention to the bridge, and precious little to what's sleeping beneath it."
"Welcome to the Howling Abyss."
"I should build an ice fortress here! Every good villain has an ice fortress."
"Welcome to the Howling Abyss. Enjoy the cold, the hunger and the ageless whispers of a dead world."
"Always with the ageless whispers."
"Welcome to Butcher's Bridge."
"Welcome to Butcher's Bridge."
"Welcome... to Butcher's Bridge."
"Welcome to Butcher's Bridge. It's a name that really... sticks with you, hmhmhm."
"Welcome to Butcher's Bridge. When you're done with the bodies, just throw them in the water."
"Well that's convenient."
"Welcome to Butcher's Bridge."
"Which one is the butcher?"
"All of them."
"Welcome to the Twisted Treeline."
"Welcome to the Twisted Treeline."

"I heard there was a giant spider here."
"I'm sure that's just a rumour."
"30 seconds until minions spawn."
"30 seconds until minions spawn."

"I better see you out there 30 seconds from now."
"Minions have spawned."
"Minions have spawned."
"Minions... have spawned."
"Minions have spawned."
"A completely expendable army! Where can I get one?"
"Minions have spawned."
"What are these things... and why are they filled with gold?"
"First blood."
