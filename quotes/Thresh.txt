"What delightful agony we shall inflict."
"It's over when I say."
"Torment comes in so many flavors."
"What is the worth of a soul?"
"Ah, the sweet tones of misery."
"I am the thing under the bed."
"Relax, just... let go."
"Oh, the eternity we shall spend together."
"Hmm, whose mind shall we snap?"
"Me, mad? Haha... quite likely."
"Poor lost souls."
"Flesh is a prison."
"Ever seen your soul? Would you like to?"
"You're falling apart. What to do with the pieces?"
"Screaming won't do you any good, but it's music to my ears."
"There is life. There is death. And then there is me."
"Lock 'em up."
"Death? No... nothing that simple."
"Nobody escapes."
"It's over when I say."
"Wretched mongrels get the leash."
"Come out and play."
"Writhe, like a worm on a hook."
"No one can save them."
"Any last words?"
"Oh, yes! It's about to get much worse."
"Come back!"
"Hook, line and sinker!"
"Going somewhere?"
"Round we go!"
"This way!"
"My house, my rules."
"Nowhere to hide."
"I own you."
"Closing in..."
"No weapon in any reality can harm us."
"Stars cold of life. Silent in the darkness."
"I will guide them beyond the brink of infinity."
"Let's see how dark it can really get."
"A star can scream. Isn't that strange?"
"We shall suck the marrow from their stars."
"Even the universe will grind to a halt."
"Cosmic extinction - how lovely."
"The cry of a dying star - nothing's sweeter."
"We will consume this world."
"A sinister star indeed."
"Ours is a kingdom of darkness."
"The stars are no longer infinite."
"I will chain the very heavens and drag them down."
"The nothingness accepts all."
"All things are eventually extinguished."
"Great works, broken and destroyed."
"I envy those who journey into the nothingness."
"Infinity, rapture, I am their harbinger."
"Not even gods dare look within."
"Oh, how I long for the final kiss of annihilation."
"We sup upon the living galaxies themselves."
"Do not prolong the inevitable."
"Nothing escapes the pull of eternity."
"Beyond the stars... hide horrors far greater than any can imagine."
"Come to me, my herald."
"Serve well, and you shall die well."
"Go forth and destroy."
"Together, we shall watch the last star die."
"What better revenge... than complete annihilation?"
"Your betrayal will not save them."
"Your betrayal will not save them."
"We have looked into the Void, and consumed it."
"Pretenders to the throne of annihilation."
"Have you ever seen a thousand stars alight in a shared dawn? We have - just before we snuffed them out."
"Join your precious stars in oblivion."
"Not even a star can escape our grip."
"Just try to take it, sackman!"
"Suns, moons? We have devoured both."
"Time is but a cog in a dying machine."
"Suns, moons? We have devoured both."
"How will you protect an entire world when you cannot even save yourself?"
"Enough death and darkness... even for you."
"You are not prepared for this journey."
"What is one life among billions?"
"Join her in oblivion."
"Time is but a cog in a dying machine."
"Ah, the light of Demacia. So sweet."
"We will show you true darkness."
"How do you intend to stop entropy incarnate?"
"Time is but a cog in a dying machine."
"Look at you. I think I'll keep you... or not."
"Oh, I've always wanted one of these... oh man."
"Stillness for all eternity."
"They struggle. How meaningless."
"Brave souls, destroyed and consumed."
"Come. Bear witness."
"The meaning of life is that it stops."
"We will all collapse into one."
"Submit to infinity."
"I am the herald of reality's end."
"We are the death of hope."
"A dark star rises."
"Snuff them out."
"Annihilation awaits."
"The galaxy will suffocate in darkness."
"We hunger."
"Their suffering makes us stronger."
"Enter the horizon."
"Gaze into the eye of annihilation."
"We are shadows cast by darkness."
"Do not fear the end. Embrace it."
"Another soul to feed the endless hunger."
"I will carve my way across the stars."
"Eternity beckons."
"We've destroyed our fair share of dragons."
"Those wings offer no escape."
"Just another stupid beast."
"Soul or no, I will feed it to the nothingness."
"I've destroyed realities. What threat is this beast?"
"A baron, eh? Baron of a dead world."
"Yes... "
"Death is no escape."
"Become one in death."
"Oh, what a wonderful world."
"A fine start."
"A trillion souls to go."
"My pull is inexorable."
"Nothing escapes our hunger."
"Join us in death."
"We shall hunt you to the ends of creation."
"Space is no impediment."
"Nowhere left to run."
"Distance is an illusion."
"Your efforts are meaningless."
"Embrace entropy."
"Of your own accord."
"Feel my power."
"Take a trip to the end of the world."
"Join me."
"You are now in my orbit."
"The downward spiral."
"Become part of something greater - nothingness."
"Death is but a dream."
"Welcome to the event horizon."
"We are inescapable."
"The stars die as we approach."
"Dreadful symmetry."
"There is nowhere to run. We've destroyed it all."
"Their screams sing me to my eternal sleep."
"Infinity is confined."
"If the universe cared, it would stop us."
"Not even light can escape us."
"They all seem to die with a whimper."
"They feed the very engine of their destruction."
"I am the vanishing point on all horizons."
"How charming."
"Fine craftsmanship - for a dead people."
"Oh, such destruction to come!"
"Use their defenses against them."
"No legion can stand before us."
"What's an aegis anyway?"
"Speed their deaths."
"Eye for an eye."
"Even the least of them may yet serve us in death."
"Mortal trappings."
"Not nearly big enough."
"My other belt is made of dead stars."
"Useful."
"A bauble."
"Ah, if it could only kindle hope. Haha!"
"Not quite my style - but it will have to do."
"Hm, they worship suns. Too bad."
"A means to the end."
"Wait 'til they get a load of us."
"We'll make relics of them all."
"They won't be needing this."
"I'll take it."
"Targon should brace itself."
"None living shall escape my sight."
"Just because you are beneath my notice doesn't mean I can't see you."
"Leave nothing to chance."
"Hiding will not save you."
"One day, this hunger will be sated."
"Much more work to do."
"Watch the stars blink out, one by one."
"Finally... "
"The embrace of nothingness... "
"Oh, thank you... "
"Only a few more stars, a few more galaxies... "
"Time, space, reality - we shall consume all."
"Beware - I live."
"Come children of hopes and dreams. Let me show you what life cannot."
"My collection is my family, and its spirits, my beloved children."
"Lost spirits everywhere. I must guide them home."
"Tiny twinkles of life, struggling ever so intensely. I will light their path."
"Ah... Life. So simple, so naive, like a flower yet to bloom."
"Torment is such a harsh word. I prefer, nurture."
"Cruelty is a gift I learn from the living."
"Spirits, alone and forsaken. I grant them all purpose."
"To the living, I am a demon. To the dead, I am a savior."
"Poor lost souls. I must save them all from themselves."
"Why must they fear me? I do not bite, I merely collect."
"Every spirit is useful. That, is why I must collect them all."
"They think me a god? No. Nothing that simple."
"Nothing more beautiful than death."
"No matter the season, death blossoms."
"Life is a prison."
"What is the worth of a spirit?"
"No need to rush. Death will bless us all!"
"I am not the end. I am the final awakening"
"I do not discriminate. All must find comfort inside my lantern."
"Death, what a pretty word."
"Life is pain, I am sweet release."
"My magic is older than life."
"Blessed are those who need my guidance."
"Me, mad? They have no idea."
"I herald the greatest blessing."
"Screams of agony echo my favorite melodies."
"To live is to suffer. To survive, is to find beauty in the suffering."
"In death, we become family."
"The dead passing to spirits. The spirits passing to my collection. That, is how it must be."
"In life, you are heroes and villains. In death, you are all my children."
"Do not fear me. I am but a servant of the natural order that guides us all."
"That little fox and I once guided spirits together, but now, I must save them from her errant ways."
"Without me, the dead would be lost. I am what drives them to greatness."
"I am friends with all spirits, until they decide to question me."
"Poor lost spirits beckoning to bloom. I've been waiting for you."
"Do not worry my dear spirits, you will all be safe in my collection."
"My children, my collection, blossom with potential."
"The living say, 'look death in the eye.' I do love an intimate connection."
"No one understands the intricacies of my collection, that is why I must never stop!"
"Those privy to my secrets? They are safe with me now."
"Deny me your spirit. I do enjoy a good chase."
"Lucian, that name. Perhaps we met in another life. Perhaps, you failed to catch my attention."
"Senna, my dear girl. I do hope you enjoyed your taste of freedom, but now, you must come home."
"You, chain warden. You have potential beyond your own understanding."
"You think yourself clever, but once a little fox, always a little fox."
"Cassiopeia, you treat the spirits with tender-loving cruelty. That, I admire."
"Wolf, why do you let this girl keep you on a leash? I pity you."
"They took your home Lillia, do not forget this loss. Let it coarse through you."
"Riven, a spirit betrayed by her own kind. That, is a tragedy I adore."
"Why, why do you exist? You stupid, raccoon dog!"
"Hunting demons only to become one yourself, Vayne. I will make you precious."
"Yasuo, the heroic warlord I've been hearing all about. I must say, I'm disappointed."
"Yone, the eldest son overshadowed by his younger brother. How could you possibly rest in peace?"
"Your spirit seems lacking in uh... anything of value."
"Many spirits have potential, but yours... yours will simply fade."
"A life not worth savoring. A death not worth remembering."
"Taunt me again. I do love hearing you mask your insecurities."
"Who's a good demon lantern? You are."
"Don't spoil your dinner now."
"My little pet. Dinner."
"Oh dear. Your wit faded long ago."
"You belong to me!"
"I've been waiting!"
"Enjoy."
"Such potential!"
"Join your siblings!"
"I will grant you purpose."
"Another lost soul."
"No more games!"
"Naughty little one!"
"Die and rejoice!"
"Play with me."
"Let it all go."
"A wandering soul."
"You are chosen."
"Freedom awaits!"
"Wretched spirits get the leash!"
"I've been waiting for you."
"Oh yes, challenge me!"
"For my collection!"
"You are lost. Allow me!"
"The end begins!"
"No need to struggle."
"Come hither!"
"Are you lost?!"
"Wrong way!"
"Where are you off to?"
"Kindle their spirits!"
"Go."
"Light their path!"
"It doesn't bite!"
"Breathe my children."
"No you don't!"
"You know better!"
"Uh-uh-uhh."
"I don't think so."
"Oh no."
"Welcome home!"
"You are mine!"
"This, is freedom!"
"Hush now. You are home."
"Welcome to my family."
"Rest. I will take good care, of you."
"And now, you have purpose."
"Call me father if you wish."
"Lucian, Lucian, Lucian. No, still doesn't ring a bell."
"Welcome home my dear Senna."
"Almost felt like I lost a piece of myself."
"Bye-bye little fox. Your children rest with me now."
"Rest now Cassiopeia. I will take care of your collected spirits."
"Enjoy your freedom, little wolf."
"Dreams of hope. No. I am afraid I cannot allow that Lillia."
"Riven, severed, broken."
"That was no spirit, no demon. That, was an abomination!"
"Look what you've become. You are my favorite child, my favorite Vayne!"
"So whiny, so angry. Typical of the second son."
"Worry not Yone. Your little brother is safe with me too."
"Five spirits, a completed collection."
"Dry your eyes. I won't be gone for long."
"Don't run off too far now. I'll only be a moment."
"Don't you know? Absence makes the heart grow fonder."
"The sweet... embrace."
"No light... only joy."
"Ah, the beautiful bangs of resurrection."
"Death, is inevitable."
"I hope my children didn't miss me too much."
"A father must always look his best."
"Glowing, upward."
"A better look, for better times."
"Ahhhh, that's better."
"Welcome to Summoner's Rift."
"Minions have spawned."
"First Blood."
"You have slain an enemy."
"You have slain an enemy."
"You have slain an enemy."
"You have been slain."
"You have been slain."
"An enemy has been slain."
"An enemy has been slain."
"An enemy has been slain."
"An ally has been slain."
"An ally has been slain."
"Executed!"
"Aced."

"Your turret... has been destroyed."
"Your team has destroyed a turret."
"Your inhibitor has been... destroyed."
"Your team has destroyed an inhibitor!"
"Your inhibitor is respawning soon."
"The enemy's inhibitor is respawning soon."
"Victory!"
"Defeat."
"A summoner has disconnected."
"A summoner has disconnected."
"A summoner has reconnected."
"Welcome to the Cosmic Ruins."
"Yes..."
"Yes!"
"No!"
"No."
"Your team has gathered half your souls."
"Your team has nearly enough souls."
"The enemy team has gathered half their souls. Hurry up."
"The enemy team has gathered half their souls."
"The enemy team has nearly enough souls. Faster!"
"The enemy team has nearly enough souls."
"Only the singularity can bring oblivion - sweet rapture."
"The Dark Star hungers for souls."
"Only the singularity will free me - free everything."
"More. More, for the Dark Star."
"Round one."
"Round two."
"Final round."
"Round one, defeat!"
"Round one, victory!"
"Round two, defeat."
"Round two, victory!"
