"They are nothing before me."
"I smell fear."
"I go."
"The dragon nears."
"On wings of fury."
"The enemies of Demacia will fall."
"Without remorse."
"The quiet before battle."
"I smell fear."
"They should run now."
"They have faced nothing like me."
"Behold my true form."
"Tremble before the power of a dragon."
"Power flows through me."
"I am unleashed."
"Come get a glimpse into the belly of the beast!"
"Think you're a dragon slayer? Come here and try."
"What do you get when a dragon sneezes? (chuckles) Out of the way."
"Suffer my fury."
"The might of Demacia will prevail."
"The rage."
"They see their end."
"They are nothing before me."
"By the blood of my father, I will end them."
"Fragile creatures."
"I will dance in their ashes."
"Feel my talons."
"Fear me."
"Power flows through me."
"Tremble before the power of a dragon."
"I am unleashed!"
"Behold my true form!"
"I love the quiet before battle."
"Dragons have no remorse."
"GG!"
