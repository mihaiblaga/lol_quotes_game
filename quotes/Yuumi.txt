"You and me, we got this!"
"More of a dog person, huh?"
"Alright! Which one of you's got great aim, and is good at chin scritches?"
"Cats make great companions! Just ask my master... who disappeared under mysterious circumstances."
"Who's ready to risk our lives, defeat our foes, and maybe knock over some cups?"
"Tell me the game plan again. Wait. Fish! Someone has fish! Where is it?"
"So, who wants to be my best friend? ...Book, I know you're already my best friend!"
"Keep an eye out for red dot, Book! It's gotta be here somewhere."
"Where's my fishy fishy fish for my dishy dishy dish?"
(Yuumi sings.) "Where's my fishy fish fish dish? Meow!"
"I won't lose you, Book! Not after losing Master."
"Today we are destroyers!" Yuumi giggles.
"Don't tell anyone but... I love hugs."
"Book, float us that-a-way!"
"Where to, Book?" Yuumi purrs.
"The expert huntress stalks the battlefield."
"A river? Uh-uh! Book hates water!"
"Do not drop me! Do not drop me!"
"This way! No THIS way! Woah-kay, that way it is."
"I'm like your ghost! WooOOooh!"
"They aren't ready for the ferocious team of... US!"
"You can pet me on my chin and back! Nowhere else. Mrow."
"Do you have snacks in your pocket? How 'bout now? ...How 'bout now?!"
"Faster! Faster!"
Yuumi yawns. "Is it time to save our friends again?"
"Ooh, you smell good! Did you recently fish?"
"Mush, mush! Wheeeeheehee!"
"I could tell you wanted a brave and powerful warrior by your side."
"Do you ever get so sleepy you fall asleep sitting up? Just me?"
"Okay, it's time to prowl! You do know how to prowl, right?"
"Rubbing my head on you means you're mine!" Yuumi purrs.
"If we find a rat, I call dibs! Or a bug. Or a FISH!"
"Wherever you go, I go! Just... don't go somewhere bad."
"Naps make my magic stronger! It's true! Look!" Yuumi snores and pretends to sleeptalk. "I'm so strong, mmh, so strong!"
"Hey Book, do you ever take a nap? ...You can't?! What do you do all day?!"
"Book, sometimes I pretend you're just a nice comfy box! ...What? That's a compliment!" Yuumi purrs.
"The Book-keeper is a great role for someone as responsible as me! ...What?"
"I save my friends? No one notices. I open a teensy portal to the spirit realm? Everyone is up in my fur!"
"If I didn't have to protect Book, I'd just be a normal magical cat floating around Bandle City! Okay, napping around Bandle City."
"I've read all of Book. Well, most of Book. I like the pictures of fish... of which there are 
none
, Book!" Yuumi meows disapprovingly.
"Ah, I miss the way my yordle scratched between my ears. ...Being read from cover to cover sounds nice too."
"Hmm, today should I follow my head? Or my nose, or.. OH! Sunbeam ahead! Let's chase that!"
"Someone scratched out the page that led here! That's right, Book. Someone! We'll never know who."
"If I ever lost you, Book, the fabric of the spirit realm would get all torn up! And I'd lose my best friend."
"I'm descended from lions! And you're descended from trees! We're in our element, Book!"
"The only thing standing between us and lunch is... our enemies."
"I am the brains, you are the brawn, Book... is Book!"
"In case you're wondering what that smell is, it's Book. Smells like old trees."
"Don't worry, I'll be here through thick or thin! Unless I smell fish. Gasp- Do you have fish?!"
"Hey, new friend? Uh, warn me if you're going to do something crazy, okay?"
"Don't get too attached, Book! This one looks reckless..."
"Hey. Hey. Hey. HEY! ...Huh? Oh no, I don't need anything!"
"You hungry? I stuck a leftover rat on page 237! Mew!"
"Do you know what "vexatious" means? Book called me that and I think it might be mean."
"If someone told you to jump in a lake, would you do it? Just 'cause... I go where you go."
"I bet we'll be friends forever! Well, unless you wander into the brush with your face."
"Get ready to face the mighty Yuumi! Oh, and Book."
"RAWR!!!" Yuumi coughs. "...'scuse me."
"Yeah, you birds can fly! Well, so can cats! This cat."
"I'm gonna eat all your leaves and throw 'em up!"
"Here, fishy fishy fishy! Meow!"
"Have you seen my master? She's about your size."
"Wow, so you're in charge of the giant litter box, huh, bird guy?"
"Hey, 
 
Kog'Maw
! I like coughing things up too!" Yuumi splutters.
"The expert huntress stalks the battlefield."
"You can't have Book, large metal cat!"
"Book, you've got it backward. You said Nasus was a god! But he's just a dog."
"Oh wow, hook man! Someone who can actually fish!"
"Oh, so you're Xayah's pet!"
"Tell me, Rengar! How do you groom all that fur?"
"Teemo?" I bet I can eat that guy! Bet I can eat him."
"Rats? I'm against them. Extremely bad."
"Make your shinylight glow, Vel'Koz! I wanna chase it!"
"The red... dot... belongs to YOU?!"
"RAWR! That's how bears talk."
"My purr is louder than your growl, dog."
Yuumi hisses and yowls. "You look like unscratched furniture!"
Yuumi hisses and yowls. "Want a book thrown at your head?! Don't worry, Book. I would never do that."
"Fishy fishy fish! Mmph-" Yuumi dives into Book to grab the fish, but comes out with bread on her head. "Waagh!"
Yuumi laughs and then coughs up a furball.
Book grabs Yuumi by the scruff and starts swinging her around. "Well, this is embarrassing!"
"Book doesn't like you."
"Claws out!"
"You're in bite range!"
"Get your 
own
 book!"
"Swat, swat!"
"Bop!"
"The ol' pounce and scratch!"
"Like a tiger."
"Scritchy scratch!"
"Attack-pounce!"
"Hiyah!"
Yuumi hisses.
Yuumi yowls.
Yuumi grunts
Yuumi grunts.
Yuumi grunts.
"Oh, I am SO knocking that over!"
"Grr, stupid overgrown scratching post!"
"I hiss at you, giant pile of stones! Hiss!"
"Ooh! Ooh! Get him! Ooh!!"
"We'll bite you!"
"Yeah! What they said!"
"Use your claws! Your CLAWS!"
"Lets slice 'em!"
"Now kill 'em! KILL 'EM!"
"Do the secret five claw technique!"
"Quick, lay on your back and kick 'em!"
"Watch out for us!"
"Cat-tack!"
"We got this? We got this."
"Do the bite-y thing! Yeah, that one!"
"I have the best aim in the spirit realm!"
"Zoooooom!"
"Book, meet new friend!"
"I'm Yuumi, and you're warm!"
"So, you need a new shield buddy?"
"I love keeping my friends alive."
"I've got a good feeling about this one, Book!"
"I'll protect you with my wild and furious... meow!"
Yuumi sniffs. "You smell tasty!"
"You smell kinda like my Yordle!"
"So does your gauntlet help you pet more cats?"
"Ooh, you're warm! ...Anyone smell burning fur?"
"I hear you're red dot's master!"
"Ooh, can I climb up on your spike thingies?"
"After this, can you play the piano while I nap, Jhin?"
"Did somebody say FISHbone?"
"Don't worry! Specters have nothing on magic cats."
"Grr! I'm a mountain lion!"
"Ah, I see you have the loud thing, to scare off the enemy!"
"Ugh! You smell like dog!"
"Just two cats, out on the town."
"Has there ever been a cat Aspect, Pantheon?"
"Book, meet giant scroll!"
"Spirit realm, here we come!"
"Okay, okay... we can make this work!"
"It's just you and me, Book!"
"I'm an independent cat."
"Back on my own! Meow!"
"Time to find a new friend!"
"We got the zoomies!"
"Now you're ready to prowl!"
"Wooooo!"
"Go go go go GO GO GO!"
"THIS IS MY FAVORITE CHAPTER!!"
"I am TOTALLY doing this!"
"I AM THE MOST MAGIIIIC!"
Final Chapter
"Get your 
own
 book!"
"Oh! I thought we were playing! Are you DEAD?!"
"I did it! I knocked it over!"
"Squashed like a bug!"
"We did it! We knocked 'em over!"
"Do you want me to bury that?"
"Woohoo! Now I can bat around the body!"
"We're killing buddies!"
"The power of friendship!"
"I bopped them all!"
"Wow, even brighter than my shinylight!"
"Heehee! They're never gonna see us coming!"
"Goodbye to the darkness!"
"I tried your thing, Book. Now let's try my thing: napping!"
"Ever pretend you're part of the floor? I do."
"I'll stick with you!"
"I guess we're going this-a-way."
"Hang on, Book. ...I am hanging on!"
"I love this paaaaaaaart!"
"Woo! Here we goooooooo!"
"No, no, no! We can fix this!"
"Book, what's happening to you?"
"Book, keep your light on!"
Yuumi yelps.
Yuumi yelps.
"Ouch! See you in your next life!"
"On to the next friend."
Yuumi yawns. "Is it time to save the world again?"
"It's okay, we've got 6 left... or was it 5?"
"Heehee! They're never gonna see us coming!"Â
