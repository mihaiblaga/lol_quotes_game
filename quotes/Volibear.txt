"Feel the power of the wild."
"You have the heart of a weakling."
"The land will exist far longer than warm-bloods."
"Their bones are ash and soil. Mine rumble with wild thunder."
"Follow me and we will bring down sky!"
"This ground will tremble with the first storm!"
"The land belongs to the wild. Today, we reclaim it with tooth and claw."
"Gods do not beg. We take what is ours!"
"I will unleash the Freljord."
"We are all blood of the wild."
"Hirnvel are sacred. Tree, soil, beast, blood!"
"I split mountains with my roar!"
"The creations of mortals fail. The wild remains."
"My thunder shakes the foundations of the world!"
"Many have tried to end me. A god."
"With each step I take, the wind gathers, and the Vrestrom grows!"
"The ursine speak for man and the wild responds."
"When the night is cruel and dark..."
"Men speak in small words. I speak in thunder!"
"Once, history was writ by tooth and claw."
"I will roar the world into stillness... so must it be."
"They have lost their wild. I will guide them."
"The soil hungers for blood."
"To destroy is to free."
"Warm-bloods rose on two legs... and forgot how to run."
"Let the land thunder with my storm."
"Battle boils the blood."
"What happens when old wounds heal?"
"Hmm. I taste iron on the wind... blood."
"This place has been tamed. I will untame it!"
"Let the storm follow in my wake."
"Ice hides the fury within."
"I carve my path with blood, and bone."
"Bones crunch. Blood drips. This is the way of old Vorrijaard."
"My land was named by a god. It cannot be renamed by a coward."
"They call me Valhir. The Volibear. Greatstorm. My true name is mine alone."
"Clouds are the storm-cloak I wrap around my fur."
"Even in a cowardly man the heart is wild. That is why it must be eaten last."
"Thunder roars. Wind howls. Only fools ignore the call to battle."
"I am Valhir of the first thunder, destroyer of the white mountain, carver of the five Fjords!"
"They have forgotten the old ways. The old ways have not forgotten them."
"The land slumbers, but it is not dead. With my roar, I wake it. With my thunder, I call it."
"Raise your idols. Huddle beneath your stone trees! Today, I tear them all down."
"Many have called to me. Avarosans. Frostguard. Winter's claw. They call no longer..."
"In my dreams, I see bones frozen in ice. I wonder... if they are my own."
"My blood is of the Vorrijaard, the land before the Freljord."
"When my brother gave them fire, they forgot the fire of their own blood."
"Darkening clouds. An omen to those who stand against the wild!"
"My sisters are gods of ice and salt and ever-winter. And Ornn? A liar."
"I am a god. I cannot die.  But  do I live if I am not in the hearts of warriors?"
"I still taste their ancestors... stuck between my teeth."
"Your towers will splinter like rotten teeth!"
"You? Such a feeble sacrifice."
"Your gods are cowards!"
"I was uprooting towns when your elders were crawling."
"Play at rage, warm-blood. I will taste the fear quivering in your guts."
"My sister. Together, we would harness a storm to consume the Freljord!"
"Sister. How long can you endure the ice burning in your heart?"
"Your war-mothers do not know true war, Ashe."
"I knew Avarosa, Ashe. Just as foolish as you."
"The heart is strong, Braum. And tastiest after battle."
"Braum. You have the lip fur of a lowly cub. Half of it is milk!"
"You have no power here young witch."
"Boy! ...And beast."
"The heart of a child is untamed. Violent in its hope... cruel in its despair..."
"You've gone soft, brother. Too much cake."
"Brother. You have lost your strongest weapons. They wither, and decay..."
"You emerge from your mountain cave, brother. Let us end this."
"Ornn. You once denied me your weapons. Now, I no longer need them."
"Rengar! I heard of your hunt. And I heard of your failure."
"Tell me, Rengar. Do your trophies make you stronger or do they weigh you down?"
"
"
"Hmm. You think you can be savage Tryndamere?"
"What a-what is that? A cub?"
"Do you have something against bears old man?"
"Weakling!"
"Coward!"
"Show me your baby fangs again. How dear."
"Live for a few centuries and you will try everything at least once."
"It is better than staring at dirt."
"The first river was a river of blood! What has my brother been telling you?"
"Your shrines will fall!"
"I will not be forgotten!"
"Weakling!"
"Vol dusk skaar!"
"Vol kau fera!"
"I roar, you bow."
"Storm devour you!"
"Torn to bone!"
"Bleed, offering!"
"I run. I tear!"
"You cannot kill a storm."
"Rolling thunder."
"Nothing but meat."
"You mean to kill me?"
"You cannot tame lightning."
"I am Valhir."
"Blood, hahahaha, always tastes the same."
"Ever-winter take you."
"Tremble at my roar!"
"Truth lurks in a warm-blood's guts."
"Your gods fear me."
"Break them open."
"Skulls, spines always crunch."
"So frail."
"A thousand scars. What is one more?"
"The ground is sown in blood."
"Tearing flesh!"
"All will crumble!"
"Storm unleashed!"
"Vrestrom consume you!"
"I am the storm!"
"So must it be."
"I feast on your heart."
"Blood. The way of the land."
"Such a death. Far greater than your life."
"A feast for the Earth."
"Your lies feed the soil."
"Another coward dies."
"My sister. May you return on swift wings."
"Oh, brother. Your forge is empty and cold."
"Ornn's blood on my claws. Surely, there was a reason. Surely, this is just..."
"I unmake your shrines!"
"Down with false idols!"
"Nothing but rubble!"
"Beneath this stone I sense no wild."
"I hear them calling Valhir. The Vrestrom answers!"
"Sky calls to me!"
"The storm gathers, and I enter sky!"
"Storms dance upon the soil."
"Born in war I fall... in war."
"I... do... not... die!"
"Whose heart calls the storm?"
"A god cannot die."
"I rise wreathed in lightning!"
"A fool and his head are soon parted"
"A fool and his money are easily parted"
