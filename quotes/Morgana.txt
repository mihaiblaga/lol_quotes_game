"Do not turn your back on me, sister!"
"I never did."
"Do not run from your shadow, Kayle."
"I am the light!"
"Those who wear armor fear death, Garen. And that's a lot of armor."
"Those you love can destroy you, Jarvan."

"Sister. You broke our family and my heart."
"Kayle, have you forgotten our father?"
"You mask your feelings, Kayle, because you have none."
"LeBlanc. Wish my twin would disappear as fast as yours."
"There is darkness in everyone, Lux. Even you."

shackled soul
."
Still playing with your little human pets, sister?
"At least I haven't smited all my friends."
"Your sword is with me. Do you want it back?"
"I need no blade."
"Why have we wings, sister, if not to fly?"
"Why do we have feet if not to tread upon the soil."
"Ugh, you again."
"Are you following me or something?"
"What have you done with mother's sword?"
"What had to be done."
"Mother must be so proud of all your murders, Kayle."

"Let me show you what it is to fall."
"Shall I remind you of your vulnerability?"
"I know how it feels to fall. So will you."
"It takes a cold heart to abandon your family."
"My cold heart is the reason we are alive."
"Kayle. Still the same hair after what, a few hundred years?"
