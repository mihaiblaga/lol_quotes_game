"Neeko is best decision!"
"They cannot handle Neeko."
"Co-'om se-henna. Oh, it means like, um... 'we smile forever.' Friends! That is the word! Friends!"
"I want to become everybody! Who says I cannot? I will prove them wrong! Then, I will become them. Last laugh? Neeko!"
"This place tastes like many emotions. Excitement, anger, joy and... salty? Is salty a feeling?"
"No more room for problems please. Only room for more cheesebreads."
"People say 'The world is Neeko's oyster'. Is oyster a good thing? Taste like grapes?"
"Sho'ma is like, um... the shape of someone's spirit, who they really are inside."
"Why do people say "Blah blah blah first, ask questions later?" Neeko need answers now!"
"Changing bodies is like changing minds. Easy. Neeko can do it! Everyone else make it difficult."
"Words are tricky. Better to speak with colors and emotion!"
"Every place is beautiful. Every place is danger. Is danger... beautiful?"
"The air is part of me. So are the flowers and the rocks. Neeko is everywhere."
"Slow down? No! Fast fast fast!"
"I will learn! I will grow! I will... Neeko!"
"Sharing memories, colors, feelings is magic! Magic connects people."
"How can anybody miss home? Home is all around."
"Neeko is on her fourth tail!"
"Survival means blending in."
"The spirits are all around me. Warm, like hugs!"
"Neeko does not want to be here when... the others arrive."
"This is very exciting! Everything is falling down!"
"Do not be bound to a single body. There are so many more."
"No, tail! We must be angry now. "People with no tails! Are they lonely? Yes."
"After fight ends, everyone invited to picnic! Even enemies."
"If Neeko knows your sho'ma, Neeko knows you."
"What to do now? Find cheesebreads? Ooh! Have picnic!"
"The Oovi-Kats are gone. Neeko is her own tribe now."
"Neeko might have a thing for birds. And bird people."
"We are to fight now? Let's go!"
"If Neeko becomes Neeko, what does she look like?"
"Beauty shines from inside, where the heart dances."
"Neeko keeps a tiny bit of everybody's Sho'ma. They are precious!"
"Where is Neeko? I saw Neeko by the river. Everyone knows Neeko likes rivers!"
"Is Neeko far? Is Neeko near? No one knows..."
"If Neeko can be everyone, how can Neeko be sure she's anyone?"
"I am definitely not Neeko. Nope. Not Neeko."
"It's fun to walk around in different skins." Neeko laughs. "I am normal! Everything's normal. Nothing is suspicious."
"Dee dee dee... Just minding my own business, not being Neeko."
"I am being me and doing... me things. Not suspicious."
"No one suspects Neeko to not be Neeko and to be not Neeko instead."
"Neeko must stay unseen... until the last moment."
"Be cool. No one suspects you are Neeko."
"Everyone fears Neeko now! Hahaha!"
"Neeko strong! Can take on world!"
"Woo! Powerful! Like jungle cat    Nidalee ! Ah... I miss her."
"Stand back! Big strong Neeko coming though!"
"Who stands in Neeko's way? Dummies with small sho'ma, that's who!"
"What does Neeko do with power? Make people behave."
"Neeko is not a sad tomato. She is a strong tomato!"
"Hello, enemy!"
"You are not secretly Neeko, are you?"
"Ice bird woman! Woo! Neeko need coat."
"Nidalee! Weird seeing you here. Neeko misses you."
"No, Rengar! Be nice and sweet like Nidalee!"
"Show me more of the world, Taliyah. Take me with you!"
"May I touch your eyeball? Neeko is gentle."
"Zyra has many thorns. Too hard for Neeko to get past."
"Fa hasici! It means I like you. In a good way."
"After fight, can Neeko tell you about Oovi-Kat tribe?"
"Hello, nature! Nature here looks funny."
"Wow! We do not have that where I come from."
"You are Vastaya! Neeko is Oovi-Kat. We are... cousins? Distant cousins!"
"YOU are in TROUBLE!"
"Battle time! Whoop whoop!"
"Too late to play nice."
"Neeko cast magic on you. Shoom! Shoom!"
"Neeko teach you a lesson."
"Rey'amash!"
"Like a wildcat! ROAR!"
"Bright means danger! "No more mister nice Neeko."
"Chitali!"
"Bagaduhng!"
"Kehkehta!"
"Yachisha!"
"Ataco, ataco!"
"I will blast their sho'ma in the face."
"Your ancestors will feel this."
"You messed with the wrong Neeko!"
"No one underestimate Neeko!"
"Who strong Neeko now?"
"So beautiful! Like moonlight on fresh snow."
"Look out! Neeko so fabulous now!"
"Beep. Boop. Neeko is metal person. Kwatz."
"Ahhh!! Neeko on fire! Just kidding."
"Not monster. Outsider looking in, wanting to belong. Like Neeko."
"Evelynn is so... extreme! Neeko curious..."
"Pretty! For a boy. Too pretty."
"Life as Garen just simple. Just swing sword around. Very bland, yes."
"Yuck! Take a bath. Gross."
"Neeko loves everything about strong... I-yao-i? Did I say it right?"
"The Vastayashai'rei tended your sapling, Green Father."
"Jinx is wild! Break everything! Phew! Phew!"
"I like angry Yordle! STAB STAB! TACOS! SKAAAARL!"
"Neeko always wanted to be a mountain!"
"So many good memories. (Sigh)"
"So many colors at once. Neeko could teach you new colors, maybe?"
"Does dragon lady want to eat lunch with Neeko sometime? Maybe?"
"Hmm... Neeko not the only one who changes."
"The light in me knows the light in Taric."
"How do three people wear one pants?"
"I like this very much! Knife-bird woman! KA-KOOO!"
"Ouch! Zyra always too prickly."
"Neeko is joyful to become you!"
"Wish I could stay like this forever."
"Neeko will try you on for size. Oooh! I love it!"
"Do I smell as bad as I look? (Sniffs) Yes."
"Male Sho'ma feels... strange."
"Looking like boys is, um... takes getting used to."
"Now we are bonded. Thank you!"
"Neeko will not break your sho'ma. I promise."
"Nice to be something different for a change!"
"Oooh. Spoooky."
"Feels same... almost like Neeko but faded."
"Neeko feels wrong. Not good. Void is full of never."
"Just yordling around. Is that what yordles say?"
"Tricky tricky! You got the wrong Neeko!"
"Not Neeko!" Neeko laughs. "Same luck next try."
"You fell for it!"
"So easy to trick."
"Nice try. But no Neeko."
"That worked! I fooled them all!"
"Goodbye, fake Neeko!"
"You messed with the wrong Neeko!"
"Boa!"
"Ayey!"
"Isso!"
"Oba!"
"Get ready!"
"Get ready!"
"Get ready!"
"Eh-duhn!"
"Zumat!"
"Can our spirits be friends still...?"
"Told you to not get close. Why did you not listen?"
"Neeko will keep your sho'ma alive."
"Oovi-Kat vacation over. Back to work!"
"Neeko was out, but never down."
"Ugh. Neeko's sho'ma went everywhere. Huge mess. Had to find it all."
"Poof! Neeko back in her Neeko skin."
"To know her was to love her."
"Hmm... Neeko not the only    one  who changes."
