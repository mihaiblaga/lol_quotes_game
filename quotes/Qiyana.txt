"You may now appreciate me."
"You are right to fear my greatness."
"GIANTS" plays. "Congratulations, you have Qiyana. The other side, they have no Qiyana."
"I would say 'watch and learn,' but unfortunately you cannot learn this."
"Oh, good, servants. Carry my panoply to the battle, would you?"
"I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I'm extremely good, at everything."
"Is that all they brought to face us? My omele could defeat them, and she is 85."
"Cover the ground behind me. None may tread where I have stepped."
"I can tell by your expressions you've never met a superior being."
"I'm through being an NPC! From now on, I make the decisions."
"I am the true ultimate boss. All other bosses are just side quests."
"I hear this game has a beautiful amazingly talented boss at the end, and her name is Qiyana."
"I will take my rightful place, ruling all Arcadia, from the home base to the majestic mountains where they stopped coding."
"Those who are 16-bit will soon grovel at the feet of the superior 32-bit."
"Some people are just born better."
"I'm not arrogant, I'm right."
"My enemies try their best. That is what is so sad."
"It's not a ring blade, it's an ohmlatl! Idiots."
"No more hiding in the wilderness. I demand to be seen!"
"If they want to worship me... hmph, I will not stop them."
"Some wait their turn, and some take what they deserve."
"In Ixtal we call them cao-mul: soon to be mud."
"If talent were an element, perhaps I could throw some at them."
"I wish there was someone else as perfect as me."
"'Empress Qiyana...' I do like the sound of that."
"Line them up. I will bend their knees."
"I do not lack empathy. Other people just need to be better."
"My feet cannot step where lesser beings have tread."
"You know what's hard about being a princess? Nothing."
"I cannot wait to be empress. If only my entire family were not in the way."
"Hard work is for those who possess no talent."
"Those who find Ixtal do not live to speak of it."
"I will grant this place the privilege of being conquered by me."
"Ugh, this place could use some reshaping."
"I'm getting hot. Where is my royal fanner?!"
"My parents rule with fairness and compassion. So boring."
"There will always be someone who is better, and that person is me."
"Things do what I tell them to. Right, rocks?"
"The secrets of my enemies carry far on the wind."
"Of course I've mastered fire... I just don't like to show off."
"It is a travesty to not be carried by servants."
"Ee-shao-can! They will all learn to say it."
"Being young means living to see all your enemies die first."
"One throne, nine sisters. Nine tragic accidents waiting to happen."
"This place will be a lovely addition to my empire."
""Let's see, what can someone do for me."
"I hate it when they dare look me in the eye."
"The perfect place to dispose of my enemies."
"I name this the River Qiyana."
"If I command the rivers to flow backward, they shall."
"I know what they are thinking: "There goes Qiyana! She is so much better than all nine of her sisters; I can't believe she's not our queen."
"We should throw a feast for me, but we'll need something to celebrate. I know! Let us crush the enemy!"
"Someday, all this will be Ixaocan. A glorious empire, with an empress to fit."
"How proud you are of your abilities, like an ape who just found a stick."
"There are levels to this competition. Better stay on yours."
"I am the shaper of lands, and who are you? A nobody."
"Why are you in my space? I cannot be seen with the likes of you."
"The rocks don't like you, the plants don't like you, and I'm pretty sure I don't like you."
"You dare raise a hand against your rightful ruler? Estem qa'eve!"
"You Pilt-ovans are like flying squirrels pretending to soar like the eagles."
"Magic from machines? How cheap and distasteful."
"I have a message for you to spread to everyone in your... Pil-tover."
"We have the great city of Ixaocan. What does your Shurima have?  Sand and ghosts."
"I have great plans for Shurima, starting with you."
"Commanding just one element must be quite dull. Then again, it's so you!"
"You only know one element? How quaint."
"First time seeing real magic? I'll go slowly so you may follow along."
"Aww, your primitive magic is adorable."
"Your magic is so primitive. Just like your sense of style."
"Impressive magic. Did you buy that at a discount?"
"Please, lizard, you cannot copy perfection."
"Why yes, I believe I will throw another rock."
"The jungle obeys me, Zyra. In time, you will do the same."
"I can see your weakness; it is just, well, all of you."
"I have humiliated my own sisters. What do you think I'll do to you?"
"I see you have mastered the element of wind."
"I claim-" Qiyana hiccups. "Claim this land for Ixao-" Qiyana hiccups again. "I will claim this land for Ixaocan!"
"Avert your eyes!"
"Saal yun esqu'uña!"
"Give me praise!."
"I command you to die!"
"Don't bring that trash over here."
"Ugh, look at you."
"Waste of elements!"
"Qi-ya-na! Say it!"
"Nuh-uh. You've got to go."
"Twirl!"
"Look around, so many ways to kill you."
"You're going to die looking like that?"
"Jaw-dropping, I know."
"Say 'ring blade' one more time!"
"Simpleton."
"Show some respect."
"Such insolence."
"Here! You're used to failure."
"You presume too much."
"Losing is your element."
"Don't walk where I walk."
"What do you think you're doing?!"
"I love your little weapons."
"You forgot to bow."
"Bow your head or lose it!"
"Know your place."
"So basic."
"Here's some advice: quit."
"Go on, amuse me."
"Why do you not grovel?"
"This is beneath me."
"Hope you brought a cheat code."
"For crushing."
"Oh rock, smash these idiots, won't you?"
"Rock is so common. Just like them."
"So many rocks, so many enemies."
"Let us throw rocks at them and laugh."
"See? The land knows it is mine."
"Stone, the foundation of empires."
"Brings out my eyes."
"I do look good in green."
"This will grow on the graves of my enemies."
"They'll never see me coming. What a shame."
"As green as the envy of my sisters."
"Oh grass, please hide me from these imbeciles."
"That chill in the air? It's me."
"Drown them, freeze them, watch them sink."
"Freeze them in their place!"
"The best thing about water? My reflection."
"Wet, like the tears of my enemies."
"They always said I was cold."
"If you bleed on me, I'll kill you again!"
"Rejoice! You are now part of the legend of Qiyana!"
"Prime Qiyana."
"That's where you belong. In the dirt."
"You're welcome. Next!"
"Who were you again?"
"Recognize."
"Not my fault. They should have bowed."
"Ha! You even die ugly."
"Failure, failure, failure, failure, failure."
"It is exhausting to crush you so much."
"Could someone dispose of these corpses?"
"Grass? Oh grass? Take me away from this tiresome battle. And can you also fan me?"
"Everyone, your future empress is leaving the fight. ...Okay, carry on."
"Excuse me! ...Uh, excuse me?! Ugh. When I return, this place better have a statue of me."
"Servants, my palanquin. Servants? Ugh, must I do everything myself?"
"Hello? Qiyanalings? Carry my digital palanquin, would you? Thanks."
"Oh, mini bosses? The real boss needs to be carried. Yes, thank you."
"Oh tiny pixelated people? Yes, whatever you are, get me out of here please."
"Nobody... touch my stuff..."
"Put a monument... here..."
"Impossible..."
"How... dare you!"
"But I'm too amazing to die..."
"See? Even death is no match for Qiyana."
"I suppose they will make me do this the hard way."
"I say give them a win. They're so cute when they think they have a chance."
"Did anyone see that?  Well, I'll just have to kill them."
"That was no crushing; that was merely a squeeze."
"Can't keep me in the ground. The ground obeys me."
"It's not dying, it's restarting from the last checkpoint."
"In Ixtal we call them  cao-mul : soon to be mud."
"Saal yun esqu'uña!"
"You dare raise a hand against your rightful ruler?  Estem qa'eve!"
"It's not a ring blade, it's an  ohmlatl ! Idiots."
"Say ' ring blade'  one more time!"
