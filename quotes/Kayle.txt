"I see you lack judgement."
"With the just hand of law I enter the fray, unbound by this mortal pettiness."
"In me will rise the strength of a thousands swords... The fury of a thousand flames..."
"When I looked into my mother's eyes, I saw a paradise for the just and glorious. It is for that world I fight."
"These endless mortal cycles... Cruelty begets suffering. Suffering begets cruelty... It ends with me."
"Grant me the strength to forge by flame, a world beyond worlds."
"Here to make excuses for their darkness, sister?"
"Morgana is here. How I relish the opportunity to battle my dark shadow."
"My sister is here. To fall before me again, no doubt."
"Hmph. I shall battle my maudlin twin once more."
"There is right, and there is wrong. All else is rationalization."
"The moment justice bends, it breaks."
"The righteous path begins with me."
"Only the divine may judge."
"Mortals are blinded by their own misery."
"A clean cut divides darkness and light."

"Would that my path be true."
"If I slip, I will fall, and so I must fly."
"I shall purify this land, with fire if I must."
"The past is for sinners. The future is for the repentant."
"I remember pain... It made me weak."
"Excuses do not concern me, only actions."
"The just rise above this mortal soil."
"Celestial justice, guide my blade."
"I took up my mother's sword, and with it, her purpose."
"Only the innocent will be spared. IF I can find any!"
"I will grow stronger..."
"I fly for the glory that shines above this caustic din."
"I cannot rest... I will not..."

"Justice is swift when borne on the edge of a blade!"
"The just cry to the heavens, I answer."
"The fire that illuminates, also cleanses."
"Only the guilty need fear me."
"My flames burn only the unworthy."
"I have given up everything for the light."
"Remember stroling together in the woods, when we were girls?"
"Hmph. You never had any fear..."
"Huh, funny I remember it differently."
"Today, it seems we must put our animosity aside."
"We've never been enemies, sister."
"How beautiful your mind must be to think such things."
"How tragic yours to believe them."
"Do not run from your shadow, Kayle."
"I am the light!"
"Do not turn your back on me, sister!"
"I never did."
"Let me grow stronger, that I might vanquish the forces of darkness. Let me transcend mortal frailty."
"I shall purge the dark within, and rise in glory!"
"Live long enough, and all lies crumble to dust!"
"I WILL bring justice to this world, no matter the cost!"
"Only those with malice in their hearts need fear the light!"
"Injustice is a festering rot, and I am its cauterizing blade."
"I shall purge this world of evil, and the fires of Justice shall vanquish the darkness!"
"The greater the evil, the greater its opposition!"
"If you were innocent, I would not be here."
"There is no hiding from the light."
"I am the consequence of your actions."
"You seem worthy, Garen. Now prove it."
"A throne won't save you from my judgement, "Highness"."
"Lux, the complicit are the worst sinners."
"Are you following me or somethingÂ ?"
"Sister, have you come to defy me again?"
"Your power could save this world, Morgana. Instead, it dooms you."
"Funny... You're on my list, too."
"You may have been innocent once, Sylas... No longer."
"You Demacians have lost your way."
"Are you a talking animal? Tiny mortal? Why are you so soft?!"
"Sister. Here to break my heart anew?"
"Better a broken heart than a 
 
shackled soul
."
"Still playing with your little human pets, sister?"
"At least I haven't smited all my friends."
"Your sword is with me. Do you want it back?"
"I need no blade."
"Why have we wings, sister, if not to fly?"
"Why do we have feet if not to tread upon the soil."
"Ugh, you again."
"Are you following me or something?"
"Mother must be so proud of all your murders, Kayle."
"Not murder. Justice."
"What have you done with mother's sword?"
"What had to be done."
"Are Yordles small children?"
"Or large... squirrels?"
"Surrender to the light and I will spare your soul!"
"Ready to be judged?"
"Still copying my hairstyle, sister?"
"The worthy survive!"
"The just rise above this mortal soil."
"It takes a cold heart to abandon your family."
"My cold heart is the reason we are alive."
"You hide behind your laws in arrogance, Kayle."
"My laws have more merit than your whims ever will."
"Evil fears only fire! And Yordles, because, what even ARE they?"
"A thief, a murderer, and a corrupt guard, all walk into my sword. The end." *Kayle laughs*
Kayle laughs.
Kayle laughs.

"Surrender and I will make this quick!"
"Fire reveals truth!"
"Save your excuses!"
"I will not bend!"
"I bring the Light's wrath!"
"The wicked shall fall!"
"The wicked shall burn!"
"Rejoice at your redemption!"
"Kneel before the light!"
"For virtue!"
"No mercy!"
"Heretic!"
"I deem you lacking!"
"Deceiver!"
"Guilty!"
"Burn!"
"Light and Glory!"
"This is your penance!"
"No sin too small."
"No mercy!"
"What's new?"
"Not even for your twin?"
"Magic tricks? Adorable."
"Suffer as I have!"
"Think you're the only one?"
"Feel something, anything!"
"Why do you think I wear armor, sister?"
"Own your frailty!"
"I am not frail."
"I make my own justice!"
"And you damn yourself."
"As evil grows, so shall I."
"These blades... My sanction!"
"The unrighteous will burn!"
"Behold, the righteous flame!"
"Heal by fire."
"Flame purifies."
"Flame purifies."
"Oh, am I pure now, sister?."
"Endure!"
"Fear me!"
"I bring the Light's wrath!"
"Let loose the flame!"
"Drown in holy fire!"
"I am your salvation!"
"The worthy survive!"
"I am your salvation!"
Oh spare me!
"Sister!"
"Kayle!"
"Redemption in the light!"
"Preach later!"
"Shielded from yourself."
"I'll ignore that."
"How "gracious" of you."
"You're welcome."
"I didn't say 'thank you'."
"You never do."
"Buried with your transgressions."
"Thus, the mighty fall."
"Your guilt was clear."
"Slain by your own sword."
"This world did NOT deserve you."
"An eye for an eye."
"I am exalted!"
"The celestial realm awaits."
"I salute the fallen."
"No... My wings..."
"I dim..."
"If I... Could see my sister..."
"The light renews."
