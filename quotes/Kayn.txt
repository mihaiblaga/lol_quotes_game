"Will you prove worthy?"
"Probably not."
"The weak fear the shadows."
"Fear controls them."
"The child is gone. The killer will remain..."
"I will survive eternity; they will die today."
"The blood of the fallen will annoint me the new master."
"Everyone does look better in red."
"Lives will be taken, and the real plan revealed."
"Killing is the plan. Let me show you..."
"The true assassin kills one to save many."
"Such noble lies. Save no one; it's so liberating!"
"Rage inside me will not be contained!"
"The spade does not dictate the architect's vision."
"Cast off the yoke of Zed's order."
"It is the order that will break you, Rhaast."
"There is fear in your grip and doubt in your heart."
"I have no heart—that you should fear."
"The undoing draws near."
"Yes—yours."
"I was born into a nation of despair and I alone am the remedy."
"I have chosen you. You will serve me."
"I have mastered every weapon of war. No prattling tool will prove an exception."
"Whom should I obey? Master Zed, or the farm implement with delusions of grandeur?"
"Underestimate me at your peril."
"Kill the body."
"Kill the mind."
"The rage is in your hands; let it loose!"
"Their screams thrill me."
"Zed's order shackles you; I offer freedom!"
"You are not worthy of the power you hold."
"This is the part I like best: the anticipation. No, it's the killing."
"Such an obsequious pupil. I will be your new master."
"Target the strong. I am a weapon, not some accessory."
"Neither time nor violence will end me."
"What does Rhaast mean anyway?"
"Obey."
"I learned from a young age to embrace the shadows."
"Darkness is a start."
"I let you go and you will die."
"And you will lose."
"I am the weapon; you are a tool."
"Lies soothe the mind, don't they?"
"What will be the final lesson?"
"Give in, and I will show you."
"I am no toy, Kayn."
"You possess the hubris of a more fearsome weapon."
"There is much darkness around you—in you."
"That is my armor."
"Tell me, was it desperation that led you to me?"
"Audacity."
"I see your nightmares. Do they trouble you?"
"Not nightmares—plans..."
"I have waited eons to bathe this realm in blood!"
"Talk, talk... You'll do nothing without me."
"Ionians... Are they all as confident as you?"
"There is no one like me."
"Wait by the river long enough and the enemy dead will float by."
"Oh, yeah... Let's turn this river red."
"Oh, how I miss the smell of blood in the water"
"Today you will be reminded."
*laugh* "Their screams will echo in this place."
"Stain this fetid swamp with their blood."
"There are a thousand ways to kill you in this moment; I'm planning the right one..."
"This will be quick, but still painful."
"I was forged to destroy, and you are in my way."
"I will take that pitiful existence you call a life from you."
"Your kind go no further!"
"Your kind go no further!"
"Yordles... Uggghhh, you sicken me."
"Death and war. This will be delicious..."
"We find Aatrox, and it's a party. Of murder. A murder party!"
"Together, we are unstoppable, Zed!"
"I can see twelve ways to kill you. Ah! Correction: thirteen. It's thirteen. "I'm holding a sentient weapon of doom, denied blood for eons! You think I'm scared of you?"
"I find your will to live amusing.."
"I smell death... No, it's you. You smell...bad."
"A craftsman never blames his tools."
"I will make an exception in this case."
"Shadows cut deep as fear!"
"Found you!"
"Cowering in the light—how foolish!"
"Fear the darkened blade!"
"The blade bends to you!"
"The shadows find everyone."
"You have my undivided attention!"
"Found you!"
"Set me free!"
"Drive me into their flesh!"
"Kill them all!"
"From the shadow comes the slaughter."
"Time to reap."
"Every slaughter has humble beginnings."
"Never underestimate hatred."
"Feed me more lives!"
"Another target!"
"More! More!"
"They're next."
"Don't wait; slay!"
"Again!"
"Yes!"
"Again!"
"Yes!"
"Again!"
"Yes!"
"They are worthy?"
"To die? Yes."
"He's with you, I assume?"
"Aatrox. We have...history."
"This brings me no pleasure, Shen."
"It will for me."
"This is your master? Zed?"
"Leave us to it!"
"Teacher and student, yes?"
"Inevitable."
"Such a waste of time."
"This will only dull the blade."
"Sure. Why not?"
"Well...we're here."
"The bigger they are..."
"The louder they scream."
"No escape."
"Fear this!"
"Yes...!"
"Yes..."
"Here we go!"
"Oh! I do like this."
"Every kill fuels my fury."
"Yes! Slaughter!"
"Just like that, and the world will be yours to destroy."
"Tenacity versus fury... Fury always wins."
"Why murder one, when you can slaughter many?"
"Triumph is built on a foundation of death."
"The strong fall so quickly to my blade."
"The only way to kill..."
"These are the strong? Pathetic."
"Worthless foes mock my presence."
"Those who seek balance find only death."
"Balance is weakness."
"This is but a taste of my wrath."
"With each kill, the shadows grow deeper."
"Death delivered with precision is true power."
"What was written in shadow, now in flesh."
"Death finds fools quickly."
"Cowards hide, but never escape."
"Fear is your shadow! You are cloaked in it."
"The shadows are my realm—and your grave."
"Shadows are a shallow grave."
"Facing me was a mistake."
"That was your destiny: to die."
"Those seeking balance will find death."
"Even Zed would be impressed."
"Hush..."
"You let me in... So foolish!"
"Ripped out!"
"That's one to remember!"
"This is power!"
"Disgusting... I love it!"
"Too late."
"I'm impressed!"
"Noxian strength is a lie."
"No mercy! Right, Noxian?"
"Sorry, brother. You were in my way."
"Your skills have not improved, Aatrox."
"Shen. Consider this a debt paid to a friend."
"Demon-pants had it coming."
"It should not have come to this, Zed..."
"You taught me too well, master."
"Live by the shadow, die by the shadow..."
"Zed's dead, baby... Zed's dead."
"Zed's final lesson? Don't be him."
"That was for Zed."
"Merely the first to die. There will be more."
"Ooohhh! That felt good."
"You never forget your first kill... Nope, that's not right; I've already forgotten it."
"That's four by my count."
"Stand back! Kayn doesn't know how deadly this thing gets!"
"You wanted mercy? Not from me!"
"Where are the worthy?"
"My potential has been realized!"
"The reaping has begun!"
"This will very much upset the balance."
"A match made in shadow."
"Aren't I enough?"
"Well, you know what you want..."
"Not my first choice, but okay."
"You're making me jealous."
"Good choice—pairs nicely with wrath and fury."
"For those who cannot see in the dark..."
"Let there be sight."
"Done. Now can we continue the bloodbath?"
"Sight...a pitiful crutch for the weak."
"Darkness falls."
"These trinkets only annoy me."
"The fight will continue."
"But there's still so much to kill!"
"Retreat?!"
"Do not question me, or my motives!"
"The weak run. Stay and fight!"
"Did such foolishness lead to your imprisonment?"
"Bring on the weak, and the strong! All will die!"
"The shadows have a new master!"
"Kayn wasted this flesh—Rhaast will not."
"That weapon was so...confining!"
"Kayn weeps in the abyss between oblivions... Idiot."
"My plan: wrath! Simple, messy, delicious..."
"I cannot wait to infest them!"
"Which to wreak first? Carnage, havoc, or mayhem? I just can't decide..."
"I am the undoing!"
"How I missed this!"
"I survived eternity. They will die today—and the next— and  the next!"
"Shadows? Perhaps. Order? Not so much."
"Their blood will decorate the ground, and the walls! Everything, really..."
"Poor Kayn! Guess I was a bad influence after all..."
"Let's go make some corpses!"
"I have broken the great Kayn; you think you can defeat me?!"
"Now I am pure wrath—fear me!"
"This ends badly for you I'm afraid."
"I will never  not  kill a Yordle."
"We're moving to plan B, Aatrox: you die."
"Do not press me, Aatrox. This is my time!"
"Varus, the three of us—um, five of us—well...together, we will lay waste to this realm!"
"Yes, Varus! Let us sow chaos!"
"Key to staying alive? Don't be you."
"You have two options: one, die quietly. Two, die loudly... Okay, one option really."
"Slash 'em up!"
"Oh yeahhhhh!"
"Wrath!"
"Cut 'em down!"
"Take the pain!"
"Take a look at this!"
"Die!"
"Reap what's too slow!"
"I want to show you something...!"
"Wrath is mine!"
"No one escapes!"
"Come here!"
"Have a slice!"
"Feel my fury!"
"Killing is so liberating!"
"Cleave them to pieces!"
"Feel this!"
"This is gonna be weird, Aatrox!"
"Nothing personal, brother!"
"Shadows aren't enough, Zed!"
"I own the dark now, Zed!"
"There you are!"
"Kayn failed; as will you, Zed! "He just won't die!"
"So little! So annoying! So  hard  to kill!"
"Goodbye, Kayn! Reaping will commence...now!"
"It's all Rhaast now!"
"Poor Kayn. All those plans for naught."
"Destruction! Wrath! Fury! As it was meant to be."
"Oh, the wrath I will unleash!"
"I do like this trick!"
*Heavy Breathing*
"Yeeesss..."
"Yeeeesss..."
"Yeeeeesss..."
"Yeeesss..."
"That was some good murdering!"
"Not worthy."
"Pitiful. They send only fools!"
"I pity the rest of your kind!"
"You're not special; just one of many!"
"Your failure mocks this world."
"No one mourns you!"
"Even your stain won't last a day!"
"Walk it off..."
"And...you're dead."
"That'll kill ya!"
"I'm outta here!"
"Such a gracious host!"
"Sorry, brother; you were in my way."
"And then there were four...I think."
"Oh, please. You would have done the same."
"No more demon-pants."
"Dead, just like Kayn."
"All your shadows, steel, and bluster...and now look at you."
"The Order of the Shadow is dead—just like you, and Kayn."
"Yes! Yes! Yesss!"
"I'm just getting started."
"I am unstoppable!"
"Try and stop me!"
"So close to perfection! Who's next?"
"Stand back! It's only going to get messier..."
"Don't stop now! I'm so close!"
"Yes! Bow before greatness!"
"Bringer of death! Taker of lives! Rhaast, if you're in a hurry."
"All have fallen before me! I am the undoing!"
"That was all me!"
"Kneel before Rhaast!"
"Is there no one left to kill? You're welcome..."
"You hear that? Neither do I—because everyone is dead!"
"Perfect; one size kills all."
"Seems redundant."
"Helpful to know who I'm murdering."
"Okay... These can be useful."
"Done. Resume slaughter!"
"What can I say? I like destroying things!"
"I prefer the sound of flesh being torn, but oh well..."
"I'd prefer to gouge out all their eyes, but this will have to do."
"I guess that is better than walking."
"I'd rather be unleashing wrath."
"I already miss killing!"
"Again! This time, they die!"
"Hm. So that's what dying feels like. Good thing I'm immortal!"
"Okay! That did not work."
"The fullness of my truth stands revealed!"
"I have snuffed out the darkin, who dares stand against me?"
"The child is gone. The killer remains."
"The blade of millenia exercises my will."
"I wield the whisper of darkness."
"I bested the darkin, now the plan continues."
"Zed now walks in my shadow."
"The reaping begins with purpose."
"Kill the body. Build the body. Free the body."
"Kill the mind. Build the mind. Free the mind."
"My path cuts through the bodies of the unwilling."
"This is as it was meant to be."
"My greatness has been realized."
"With this blade, I am invincible!"
"Light offers no sanctuary."
"True believers live forever, they will die forgotten."
"Bathing my enemies in shadow, I leave the light to the opressed."
"I was forged by the uncaring providence of war."
"Every corpse a lesson, every threat a target."
"The darkin is gone, our enemies are next."
"Your stance is that of a two-legged goat."
"This is the part where you run."
"Together Zed, we are unstoppable!"
"They will never see us coming."
"I'll let you in on a secret, you will not live much longer."
"The light's your best chance, but you're still going to die."
"There are twelve ways to kill you. Sorry, thirteen. It's still thirteen."
"Hah ha ha ha..."
"Shadows touch all!"
"Your mistake!"
"No way out."
"I'm here!"
"I am everywhere."
"This will be quick!"
"Silence, then pain."
"Run, from the shadows."
"You dance on the shadows edge."
"Shadow is not your friend."
"The light will not save you."
"Fleeing won't save you!"
"Feel this!"
"I'm coming for you!"
"Pain fades..."
"Death is inevitable."
"Die, Noxian!"
"I will enjoy this, Darius."
"Revenge..."
"How tedious."
"These things always prove to be a challenge."
"Ughh... This may take a while."
"I am the shadow of death."
"I am chosen! The darkin stain lives no more."
"In death, Rhaast now serves me."
"I am now one! I am the one!"
"No escape..."
"I am everywhere!"
"Hush..."
"Hah ha ha ha..."
"Fools die and are forgotten."
"Retreat was a better option."
"So brave, so foolish, so dead."
"You will not be remembered."
"You were not chosen—to live..."
"There was a time to run, but you missed it."
"Wrong place, wrong time."
"Be thankful it's over."
"Surprise!"
"Goodbye!"
"So easy."
"That never gets old."
"Strength alone is not enough."
"You and Rhaast, the failed blades."
"Zed says hello, and goodbye."
"It did not have to end this way, Zed."
"Your stance was weak, your tactics elementary and your execution sluggish."
"The more they send, the more they will bury."
"The fallen only make me stronger."
"Shadows and the blade proved too much."
"Perfection is near..."
"That may do, for some."
"Four. Who's next?"
"And that is why I am the one."
"They too will call me master."
"They should stay down."
"Death finds all, and so quickly."
"Balance? Balance favors the victorious."
"I buy, they die. Simple."
"Oh yes, this is the right choice."
"I live in shadow, others need light."
"My enemies will have no place to hide."
"This trinket may prove useful here."
"Oh, please."
"Sight, a pitiful crutch for the weak."
"Are you afraid now? You should be."
"That was not the plan."
"A lucky stab in the dark."
"That only served to sharpen my focus, and my blade."
"Can the others hear me?"
"I don't think so."
"So you sound like a lunatic, excellent."
"So we're allies, are we? Fine."
"Stop talking to them, idiot!"
"Oh good, insults. That's the way to make friends!"
"Rhaast..? Why are you trembling?"
"It's nothing Kayn. Nothing at all."
"The crew of the Morningstar! Here and ready to die!"
"Remember, leave the templar alive."
"Yes, yes, whatever."
"I can feel them Kayn. Those troublesome little rats."
"So we kill them all?"
"Eventually... yes."
"There is power locked inside you Rhaast, and I will have it."
"Oh good, more empty threats. You know how much I love them."
"With the Ora you wield, we could destroy everything!"
"With all the stupid things you say, we could fill a library."
"Kill them Kayn. Show me the power of our future emperor."
"You didn't say the magic word."
"This world will be the first step on my road to conquest."
*Sinister Chuckle*
"Talk, talk, talk. All you ever do is talk, Rhaast! Learn to read a room."
"It doesn't matter what you are Rhaast. I'm going to win, and you're going to die. "
"My Ora is none of your concern, Rhaast."
"I should've bombed this toilet world from orbit."
"Deep down Rhaast, I know you're scared I'll win."
"While our useless emperor sat on his throne, I ensured the survival of our dominion."
"Identify the weak link, and break it!"
"You're pretty confident for an antiquated lawn mower Rhaast."
"I've trained all my life to serve the empire. Now it will serve me!"
"I will be emperor. I just need time and Ora."
"This is all this galaxy has to offer?"
"Slaughter them all. And drink deeply."
"Stride forth, Kayn. Burn the galaxy behind you."
"I am asleep and awake. The voice of Ora! Locked behind a cumbling wall."
"An empire that spans galaxies. And you still can't afford a decent haircut."
"They use our blood for fuel Kayn! Our Ora, and they will pay so dearly."
"Newly minds cannot comprehend... uhh, how deserving you truly are."
"Ora is ambrosia. So sweet, so pure."
"Gourge yourself on Ora Kayn. Only you are worthy."
"The best thing about Ora, is how it tastes."
"Build your empire, over their graves."
"Give in to the carnage. Lose yourself in me."
"So you're the voice of Ora."
"Yes, and your guiding star."
"The universe will be mine!"
"We'll see."
"Unlock my power, I command it!"
"Settle down. You're embarrassing yourself."
"You're just a tool to me, Rhaast."
"How ironic."
"I don't need you to rule the universe."
"Then why can't you put me down?"
"Don't you have any flair for the dramatic!?"
*Yawn* "Spare me."
"What are you? Really?"
"All the Ora within you."
"They will learn to fear the name of Kayn!"
"Just kill everyone! It's much more efficient."
"I'm not sure I believe Ora is sentient."
"I don't care what you believe."
"Do you know the difference between a villain and a monster?"
"The will to do what's necessary."
"For an ancient mysterious artifact, you sure love to hear yourself talk."
"I've been trapped on a backwater planet for untold millenia. Indulge me."
"Where did you come from? What do you want?"
"Your feeble mind couldn't comprehend it if you tried."
"Why do they run from the inevitable?"
"It makes for a better story."
"Null this insufferable life!"
"Yes you're a monster, very scary."
"Don't you feel it Kayn? The desire to rule! The desire for carnage!"
"Every waking moment."
"In the future I see a great empire!"
"
"
"I am no mere plaything."
"You said it, not me."
"So. Much. Ora within you!"
"Quit looking at my Ora."
"Kill them all! It would be so easy."
"And so uninspired."
"Burn! Slaughter! Destroy!"
"Ever the cliché."
"Your thirst for violence demands satisfaction."
"Satisfy yourself. I have bigger plans."
"Sometimes I question your resolve."
"Rhaast, I'm hurt."
"One day I will rule the universe."
"Maybe, if you focus for once."
"Wow Rhaast, I thought we were friends."
"Soon they'll all worship at my feet."
"Is that truly all you desire?"
"Oh Rhaast, of course it is."
"What does the voice of Ora say today?"
"Go to hell Kayn."
"Already there Rhaast, already there."
"Why is that girl staring at me?"
"She is attracted to our violence."
"Oh..."
"Malphite! What a loyal dog you are."
"Dogs die everyday."
"At last, Sona. The secrets of the Ora Gate will be mine!"
"Yes... yours..."
"Captain Yasuo! Why don't you tell me where you're hiding the templar?"
"And then die!"
"So you're that disgraced miner Ziggs."
"Not even good enough for the B Team!"
"Do you know who I am?"
"They require a demonstration!"
"We'll make a game of it. You try to survive-"
"And we slice you in half."
"What is this... thing before me?"
"Just another worm."
"Are they taunting us!?"
"And I thought you were a drama queen."
"Does that gaudy crest serve as a shield?"
"No."
"Interesting..."
"What exactly are they the master of?"
"Dying, being dead. Both."
"Hey Rhaaast."
"What?"
"Rhaast."
"What!?"
"
"
"
"
"...Hi."
"Should we do Karaoke night again?"
"No one can know about that."
"So... next weekend, then?"
"...Sure."
"An imperial soldier and a monster from an alternate reality walk into a bar-"
"Waait! What was that last part?"
"They're in a bar, Kayn! Pay attention."
"Do your people consider that funny?"
"We do not."
*Kayn Laughs*
*Kayn Laughs*
"You look strong."
"Misguided fool."
"This will be riveting."
"Let's swat this insect!"
"Surgical precision."
"You are annoying."
"Mind if I cut in?"
"This one's mine."
"Let's make this quick."
"A welcome change of pace."
"Let's get you some new scars."
"Ahh. A volunteer."
"Don't cry when you lose."
"Don't run. I hate that!"
"Drown them in me!"
"Haha! Marvelous!"
"Shatter their bones!"
"Drag me across their throats!"
"Drive me into their heart."
"What boundless violence!"
"Pain. Bring them pain!"
"Cut off their face."
"Let the darkness in."
"Rip out their organs."
"I want to hear them scream!"
"Keep cutting."
"Spread my silence."
"Radiant flesh!"
"Cull their numbers!"
"Come and play, Jinx!"
"Haha, so much flesh to rend, Malphite!"
"Sona! You will open the gate!"
"Face me Captain! Face me and die!"
"You should never have come here, Ziggs."
*Kayn Grunts Twice*
*Kayn Grunts Twice*
*Kayn Grunts*
*Kayn Grunts*
"Nowhere to run."
"Hush..."
"Why keep them waiting?"
"I'm always close."
"How interesting."
"Such a useful talent."
"Your Ora is mine."
"Peekaboo."
*Kayn Laughs*
*Kayn Laughs*
"What inviting insides!"
"How wonderful!"
*Rhaast Laughs*
*Rhaast Laughs*
*Yawn* "Good job. What's next?"
"Is there anyone left who can keep up with me?"
"Right down the middle!"
"Bah, I win."
"That sounded wet! Was it organs? Was it blood?"
"One less subject to rule. Right, Kayn?"
"The empire thanks you."
"As do I."
"Hmm, that murder reminded me of home."
"How sweet."
"Did those two... seem familiar?"
"I think I'm having an existential crisis."
"I admit, she was cute."
"Oh are you kidding me?"
"If only they all had that much flesh!"
"Eugh, Rhaast. Nooo."
"I told you to leave her alive!"
"Change of plans."
"First your brother, then you. It's poetic, really."
"He popped! How splendid!"
"I think some got on me."
"Get off my planet! Get out of my galaxy, and stay...  dead ."
"It's like they were never there!"
"High five Rhaast!"
"Down low - oh, I don't have hands. How mature."
"We need to regroup."
"Regroup, or retreat?"
"T-they're the same thing!"
"Really?"
"What happened to us Kayn? We used to be so good together."
"I hate the way you say that."
"What, getting tired already?"
"I don't see you helping out."
"I'm the scythe, idiot! I only help out!"
*Death Rattle*
"Please, don't drop me on the ground."
"A little help... Anyone?"
"Wait, how are we still alive?"
"That, would ruin the surprise."
"I don't trust how easily you brought me back to life."
"Would you rather stay dead?"
"...No."
"I won't let you die that easily."
"I appreciate the thought."
"I'm sure you do."
"It turns out the scythe was evil and wants to annihilate all reality. Who could've guessed?"
"What an honour, Kayn. To watch me slaughter everything you wished to rule."
"The test has ended. I am victorious! I am the herald of oblivion! I! Am! Rhaast!"
"Bare witness to the Dark Star! Bare witness to Rhaast!"
"Kayn is gone. What is left is ruination!"
"Scream for your lives, your world! Scream my name as I rip it all to pieces!"
"It draws close. A vast and broken god."
"Witness the turning of the wheel. The culmination of this foul existence."
"We're all hurtling towards annihilation. I love it!"
"Oh, the symphony of violence I will conduct."
"The entrails of countless realities are shattering in my wake!"
"The voice of Ora? Heheha, what a joke."
"I herald an endless ocean of silence. It will be... transcendent."
"Love! Hope! Fear! I will feast it upon them all!"
"Is it too late to mention I'm a corruptant, forged by the Dark Star? Sorry Kayn."
"Every luminous star laid bear. Torn open, devoured."
"Decay! An ecstasy I will carve into creation."
"Desolation lays before me, spanning endless eons until even time... dies!"
"This reality has such... delicious entropy. "
"They should never have opened that gate! Hahaha!"
"Look Kayn! Gaze upon my works, and despair."
"So much exquisite pain to deliver. Oh, I shudder at the thought."
"Pray for salvation that never comes!"
"You've taken such good care of this body Kayn. Such exacting care."
"I feast upon the bones of unhallowed centuries. Nothing will escape me."
"I am the beautiful end, that awaits us all."
"Hear the sweet whispers of oblivion."
"I do look better in gold! Hehaha!"
"Yes! The convulsing of the stars! I can taste their delectable screams."
"Know true fear, for I am the star where nightmares breed!"
"Poor Kayn! Our would-be emperor tumbling endlessly into darkness!"
"The succor of an endless void. Do you feel it Kayn?"
"The geometry of space bends, and breaks, and bleeds!"
"Kayn's Ora will fuel my slaughter! Ahahaha, oh yes."
"Well now, I'm not familiar with your universe. But oh, how I could be."
"I'll paint the dying stars with your entrails, and love every second of it."
"There will come soft rains of liquid night, when our empty god descends from its heaven."
"Remember to scream my name when I tear out your organs. That really does it for me."
"Are you watching my sovereign? We are but humble servants."
"Such bravado! I must free it from your prison of flesh."
"Mastery! The last twitch of a dying insect."
"I'm gonna use that mastery to saw off your head."
"Who wants to party before the world ends? Anyone? Just me? Fiine."
"I'm not acting creepy. I'm just really excited to be here!"
"Here's a funny one. I'm going to kill you. Hmhe, end of joke! End of existence! End of everything! Hahahaha!"
"Heyahaha! I love peeling open the funny ones."
*Rhaast Laughs*
*Rhaast Laughs*
*Rhaast Laughs*
"Oblivion awaits!"
"Nothing will survive."
*Crazed Laugh*
"The nightmare begins!"
"Oh, how I've waited for this."
"May the violence never end!"
"I will rip you apart."
"More. Mooore!"
"Now's the feast!"
"Let's open you up."
"What joyous carnage!"
"Die! Die!"
"Annihilation!"
"I'm gonna get so much you on me."
"Entropy awaits!"
"I will devour the stars!"
"Yes, more violence!"
"Every dying scream; they're all mine!"
"I will paint the walls with your entrails!"
"Scream before the end!"
"Sweet desolation!"
"I want it. Every cry of agony!"
"I never want this to stop."
"I will carve myself upon you."

"Poetry in motion!"
"No! I'm not done playing yet."
"The Dark Star is mine Thresh! Only Rhaast is worthy."
"Jinx! Let's see who can do the most damage."
"Malphite! So much flesh to carve!"
"Face the monster you've unleashed, Sona!"
"You will greet oblivion with joy, Yasuo!"
"Ziggs! Let's end this with a bang."
"Give your flesh to me!"
"What a beautiful body!"
"What's happening?"
"I lied!"
"WHAT IS THIS!?"
"The Dark... Star!"

"Ooohh yes..."
"Yesss..."
"Where are you hiding?"
"Mmmm..."
"This will be fun..."
"Here comes the good part!"

"Rage! Rage against the dying of all light."
"And yet, there is so much wonderful work to do."
"How many countless eons have I waited to kill? Too many!"
"Squirm in your own steaming guts."
"More bodies. Give me more warm bodies.	"
"The pleasure," *inhale* "Was mine."
"Oblivion is too good for you. Come back, so I can tear you apart again."
"It's all Rhaast now!" *Laughs*
"I'll let the rest of you in when I'm satisfied. And not a moment sooner."
"Don't worry Thresh. Soon enough we'll all join you. "Sad little girl. You have no idea what violence truly means."
"The bigger they are, the louder they scream."
"I thank you templar. For dooming all of creation."
"The only odyssey awaiting you, captain, is your own extinction."
"Hmm. Your exploding body, reminds me... of other, exploding bodies."
"Fear the coming of the dark!"
"I will wash this universe clean!"
"Such ecstasy! Such resplendent horror!"
"Don't worry, I won't be gone long. If you do need me, just whisper my name."
"Wait here for me. If I come back to any new dead bodies, I'm gonna be so angry."
"I have so much slaughter to invoke, so I can barely keep track!"
"Sweet... oblivion..."
"Noooo... the gate..."
*Death Rattle*
"I am born again!"
"It's too late for this universe! Rhaast will always return."
"Slay me as many times as you can! The Dark Star will not be contained."
"My throne awaits! I can see it. I can see everything!"
"Oh Rhaast. You were holding out on me. This power feels so, good!"
"Universe! Greet your emperor, and know despair!"
"Rhaasty boy! What is this energy? I could rule over everything!"
"I can feel Ora coursing through my veins! This. Is. Sublime!"
"Divine providence. Unlimited power! Kayn."
"So much left to conquer. So much left to accomplish."
"Rhaast dared to test me, and was the first to learn his place."
"I passed the monster's test! I alone am fit to rule."
"Pray for any world that draws my attention."
"Rhaast, are you still in there? Because I won."
"They will worship Kayn!. Rhaast is dead."
"My power will stretch into eternity! None may challenge me."
"They will sing my name for a thousand years!"
"My grandure will not be sullied."
"Subjugate all worlds! Every last one of them."
"All will kneel. Or burn with their worlds."
"Emperor Kayn. Such a magnificent title! I love it."
"Look upon me, world! Look upon your saviour!"
"Now to bring the galaxy to its knees."
"They will love me. They will loove me!"
"It's not the grandest stage for my empire. But it will be."
"An endless sea of stars, each one ripe for conquest."
"Every star in the sky belongs to me!"
"I know you're watching Rhaast. And I love how much you hate this."
"Was there ever a greater emperor than Kayn? Nooo."
"All great armies are mine to command."
"I will rule as a tyrant, and they will love me for it."
"Worship my limitless splender! Worship it."
"Emperor Kayn! King of kings, our great will! Our guiding star."
"This universe, and everything in it, is mine."
"First I conquered the weapon, and next? Everything else."
"The timeless gulf of infinity. Completely at my mercy!"
"I'm the one with power now Rhaast! You hear me!?"
"With this much Ora at my command, my empire is invincible!"
"Praise my name! Praise Emperor Kayn!"
"You stand on the precipice of a deadly fate. Take a step. Face your emperor."
"I suppose I could honour you with death. All part of my duties, after all."
"What can I say? You're either the emperor of the universe or you're not me."
"You poor fool. You've just made a grave mistake."
"Everything belongs to me, worm. Even that mastery."
"Look at you. Flashing that utterly average mastery for everyone to see."
"I'm perfectly sane. Rhaast hasn't had any undue effect on... do you hear singing?"
"Hey Rhaast, remember the time... right, right you're dead! I killed you!"
"The emperor is wearing clothes! Who said he wasn't? Was it you!?"
"You find that funny? What a small, insignificant speck you are."

"Ora, Ora, Ora!"
"I said bow!"
"You will fall in line."
"Resist and die!"
"Scream for your emperor!"
"Kneel before me!"
"I want it all. Everything!"
"No escape!"
"How dare you look upon me?"
"It's all mine."
"No one is worthy."
"Stand aside, worm!"
"Nothing can stop me!"
"Face me, filth!"
"For my empire!"
"You're all worms!"
"You've failed the test."
"You aren't worthy."
"I'll despoil a thousand worlds!"
"Hate me! Fear me!"
"My power is endless!"
*Crazed Laugh*
"I'm everything you wanted and more, Jinx!"
"Malphite! Come at me, dog."
"Rhaast can't save you now, Sona!"
"You won't escape me this time, captain."
"Come, Ziggs. Test your new emperor."
"Surrender yourself... to me!"
"The test is over Rhaast."
"No... Nooo..."

"So easy. It's all so easy."
"I will take on all challengers to my throne."
"You could never hope to stop me, but I love that you tried."
"But I digress, who are you again?"
"Did you see that Rhaast?" *Nervous Laugh* "...Rhaast?"
"Didn't you know? I'm the emperor, so I win."
"No one will take my throne from me! Not even me."
"How sad. You would have made an excellent concubine."
"Now play dead. Who's a good boy?"
"Goodbye, templar. And thank you for control of the universe."
"If you want my personal opinion, "Hasaki" is a really sad choice of last words."
"Isn't this better than dying alone on some backwater? You can answer later."
"Hail Kayn! The all-conquering!"
"All will bow to my greatness!"
"Rejoice! Your emperor is here!"
"Can't trust the councilors. They're too tainted. Rhaast would've said... Hmhmhmhm Rhaast... "
"No line of secession. Hunt down everyone, all of their offspring, until there is only Kayn."
"The ruling bodies will have to be disassembled by force. Yes, cut them apart."
*Death Rattle*
"But I was... invincible..."
"My... empire.."
