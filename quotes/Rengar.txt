"Tonight, we hunt!"
"A true hunter never rests."
"Walk the killer's path."
"I seek only the strongest."
"Catch their trail."
"Comfort breeds weakness."
"A true hunter never rests."
"The scent of prey."
"Monsters can be made to fear."
"Strike when ready."
"There is the hunter and the hunted."
"Whose head shall I take?"
"You have a warrior's heart. I think I'll take it."
"You've earned a good death. I've earned the kill."
"All these trophies... I'm gonna need a bigger den!"
"So much bloodshed... This is my kind of place!"
"A fitting prize."
"Nothing will escape."
"Carve off a souvenir."
"Another piece for my collection."
"Their heads will adorn my wall."
"Lesser creature."
"Let's see what they're made of."
"Each Trophy a victory."
"Remember every kill."
"Spoils of the hunt."
"Never return empty-handed."
"A token of my conquests."
"I'm just getting started."
"A fine collection."
"More prey, more prizes."
"Leave only a trail of bodies."
"What a glorious hunt!"
"Come on!"
"Let's fight!"
"Not so fast!"
"Slow down!"
"Don't trip."
"Easy prey."
"Listen."
"Focus."
"I see you, wretched creature!"
"I've found you, beast!"
