"A step ahead of cataclysm."
"Fine."
"I find the runes so they won't be found by someone else - or some 
."
"The things I've seen in the dark corners of Runeterra are better left unseen."
"Things to do today: find food, build shelter, fix the world."
"I sense another rune, but where?"
"Can we make this quick? I have some place to be!"
"If I sound rude, it's because I've got a world to save."
"These runes are not for eyes such as yours."
"They know so little of the world they traverse."
"Ah, Runeterrans. So endearing, so foolish."
"I work alone. Company weighs me down."
"What's on my back? That's not your concern."
"Knowledge is a real weapon."
"Every rune I find is another day we live."
"Blessing or curse, what's the difference?"
"They have forgotten the fires that forged this world."
"You know what I could use? An ale."
"They want to read my scroll. It'll be the last thing they read."
"I could tell you what's on this scroll, but then I'd have to obliterate you."
"The wise seek to contain power."
"I dream in nightmares of the past."
"None are worthy of my task... even me."
"Everyone is doomed to repeat history. That's where I come in."
"I've heard entire nations go silent."
"I may fail, but I won't quit."
"Trust no-one, especially those who seek power."
"Just once I'd like a good night's sleep."
"Their minds couldn't handle what my eyes have seen."
"I care about these mortals. That's why I keep them at arm's length."
"In an instant, all could be gone."
"I long for the day when this is all over."
"Some stones are best left unturned."
"Everyone wants to chat when you're busy saving the world."
"Terrible things are afoot."
"You know what I miss? Standing still."
"All that binds this world is will."
"Magic dooms us... but perhaps it can save us."
"Do not walk through history. Run."
"Power changes everyone."
"One can only hold all this power for so long."
"If I had a rune for every mile I've run, I'd be done running."
"You want to help? Get out of the way."
"I remember when only one world weighed on my shoulders."
"When I've found them all, I'll fade away."
"If I fall, the scroll must be destroyed."
"I fight so they don't have to."
"Roast duck, warm fire... someday."
"Quickly but carefully."
"The runes decide my path."
"My story? That would take ages to tell."
"Consider yourself lucky for the days you have."
"Take care with this world."
"Fast and lean, that's how I travel."
"Ah, civilization. I remember when I was a part of it."
"No time to talk."
"I like my tragedy narrowly averted."
"All this would be so much easier if I didn't give a damn."
"Hm. I'm hunted by things far worse than you."
"I'm no doctor, but I think there's a spell for what you have."
"To be ignorant is to be free. You must be very free."
"If I had a tattoo that looked like you, I'd get it removed."
"There's gonna be two sounds - me hitting you, and you disintegrating."
"You wage your petty war, Noxian, but the real war is yet to come."
"Even your kind will know death in the cataclysm."
"Your charms are impressive, but I'm not into forest creatures."
"Run along, child, this tome is not a bedtime story."
"Space called, it wants its arrogant jerk back."
"I don't suppose you'd want to get off your magical rear and help me save this world."
"I have a hard time believing you went to medical school."
"I would chide you for your idiocy, but you seem pretty proud of it."
"Nice tattoos, do they conduct runic energy? No? Oh, that's too bad."
"Magic is more than sunshine and rainbows, girl."
"Hey, you're the one who summons bloodthirsty Void creatures, right? Yeah, brilliant work, good thinking."
"Nice card trick, do you do birthday parties?"
"That remarkable arcane energy doesn't run through your entire body, does it?"
"We'll see how smart your mouth is when the world collapses."
"I'm surprised you can string enough words together for that one. You need a break?"
"So that's what you people do with your spare time."
"Not going to dignify that with a response."
"You should read more, expand your vocabulary."
"What? You want to see a magic trick? Fine... tada."
"Okay, fine, here's a magic trick. Tada."
Ryze laughs.
Ryze laughs.
Ryze laughs.
"Keep your distance."
"I read the runes. You lose."
"Blood will spill."
"Makers guide me!"
"They come for the scroll."
"Time dwindles."
"Are you following me?"
"You know nothing of loss."
"I am just a vessel."
"A fine edge you dance on."
"By will."
"I don't have time for this!"
"If you insist."
"Fine."
"This ends badly."
"This might burn."
"Hands off the runes."
"They have no idea."
"Leave now."
"Ah, the hard way."
"Stay back."
"Away."
"You've got nothing."
"You won't win this."
"Last chance."
"Let's have it, then."
"There it is."
"Release."
"Zap."
"Back."
"Push."
"Out."
"Right."
"Like dominoes!"
"Compounded!"
"Expand!"
"Trap!"
"Catch!"
"Hold!"
"Root!"
"Cease!"
"Gotcha!"
"Be still!"
"Steadfast!"
"Locked up tight!"
"Mark!"
"Fix!"
"Target!"
"There!"
"Our fight is elsewhere."
"A rune mage must keep moving."
"Come. The runes beckon."
"Flee if you want to live."
"Let's go, let's go!"
"Another joins the energy pool."
"Better you than me."
"They never learn."
"Another dead fool."
"One more needless death."
"Learn from your mistakes."
"Won't be the last."
"That's what happens when you piss off an archmage!"
"Better a few perish than the entire world."
"I tried to warn them, I really did."
"They make the same mistakes again and again."
"Too many have met the same fate."
"That's gonna' load me down."
"Great, more things to carry."
"This better work."
"Provisions purchased."
"An object of foul origins."
"Many lives it's taken, and many souls."
"Strange how it beckons."
"Fuel for the rune race."
"Now I'll never tire."
"Sweet rune juice."
"Such a vile text - but useful."
"Not a book for the faint of heart."
"A sordid relic from a brutal time."
"To cover my bald spot."
"A hat with a face, huh? Sure, why not?"
"A potent haberdashery."
"In case my head gets cold."
"It's a start."
"Fundamental."
"Brings out my colour."
"Even the gods can weep."
"Now we're talking."
"I remember when such tears were shed."
"I can feel its power surging."
"I'd destroy it - if I didn't need it."
"Such a weapon must be treated with respect."
"I defy swords and arrows."
"Their weapons will fail to scratch."
"Protection from primitive arms."
"I thought that guy would never stop talking."
"Sight is better than swords."
"For whatever lurks behind me."
"If I can see it, I can beat it."
"They come for what I know."
"Sight makes might."
"Watching the watchers."
"I never liked surprises."
"Dark corners made bright."
"I'd like to see them try."
"Dark shadows hide dark forces."
"One less thing to kill me."
"Another barrier down."
"Let's move, the path is clear."
"One less impediment."
"Reduced to rubble."
"What is made can be unmade."
"Always learning, always seeking."
"Those who seek improvement, improve."
"To the next one."
"This power continues to build."
"A pause in the chaos. Let's make it count."
"I'll return stronger. Count on it."
"I'm not running away. I'm running at you the long way around."
"Hang on, archmage business."
"Time to reflect on what we have learned."
"A moment to gather our runes."
A crowd cheers.
"The scroll... burn it... "
"Hide... them... "
"They will not... take them... "
"Thank the gods, the world's still here."
"A stupid mistake, one I won't make again."
"I still live, but for how much longer?"
"Let's try again, and this time do it right."
"Ugh, being dead wastes precious time!"
An eagle screech is heard.
"I will show you arcane magic."
"You show promise!"
"GG!"
