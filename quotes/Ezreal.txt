"Quest accepted! …Wait, where are we going?"
"Hey, your loss. But I get it."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. World. Peril. Save it. I got it, I got it."
"Huh, could've sworn there was a hidden entrance around here somewhere."
"Where there's treasure, there's glory. And where there's glory… Girls are watching."
"*sigh* I don't care where here is. Just point me toward adventure."
"To save video games, he had to become video games. Ezreal is… Video games."
♫"Burning Bright! Nah-nah-nah-nah Nah-nah-nah-something."♫
A stripped-down version of "A New Horizon" plays, which then switches to "Burning Bright".
"Impossible comebacks are sorta my specialty."
"The gauntlet's for show… the talent's all me."
"Jarro Lightfeather never gives up. He learned that from me."
"I'm at my best when the worlds at the brink of annihilation."
"Little piece of advice: If no one tells you something is impossible, then it's still possible. So go do it."
"I rarely know what I'm looking for, but I always find it."
"Never met a problem that I couldn't blast away with magic. That I don't even understand."
"True explorers follow the compass in their heart."
"If I don't know the rules, then how can I be breaking them?"
"I'm in my element, fighting evil. Life is good."
"I hate the word 'steal'. I prefer the word 'liberate' or 'procure'."
"When you've got talent, there's not such thing as a lucky shot."
"Oh, a plan. Yeah, I totally have one of those."
"Exploration runs in my family. It's in my blood."
"I'm always open to new ideas. My new ideas."
"Once it's a ruin, I can legally loot it."
"Nothing stops me. Except for Shuriman parasites. It was… not pretty."
"I can't get hauled into wizard court again. Technically I don't have a permit for the gauntlet."
"They really hate me in Shurima. And in Noxus. Demacia's lukewarm on me. Haven't been to Ionia yet, seems nice."
"Last time I was in Shurima, I decoded some glyphs. Something about a jackal head… End of times… The usual. All I wanted was this ruby scarab. It looks great on my mantle."
"Yeah, we'll liberate a priceless artifact or two. Kill some bad guys. Maybe save the world. Y'know, typical hero stuff. It'll be great."
"It's not grave-robbing if you have a college degree. Which I do… *cough* not have a college degree."
"I unearth the secrets of the past and sell them to the highest bidder. Does that make me a criminal? …Don't answer that."
"I use a fake name in Demacia: Jarro Lightfeather. Sentinel of Light, 8th Order. He's a national hero."
"I don't read books about the world. I go out there and see it for myself."
"No plan survives first contact with me."
"There's an unspoken law in archaeology: Finders, keepers."
"Feels like the whole world's gone crazy. Right on schedule."
"Who needs a map?"
"Some people call me a hero. Their word, not mine. But it does have a nice ring to it."
"Ooh, did I save my game before this?"
"I'm rated E for Ezreal."
"What level am I on?"
"Ez tanks, locked and loaded."
"Uh, I hold the speed-running record for Hyper Crystal Dungeon. This is nothing."
"Woo! Just unlocked the 'Awesome at Everything' Achievement!"
"Huh… Where's the warp zone?"
"I'll beat this… League of Legends?"
"Star Guardians for life! Except during Ezreal time. Gotta have my Ezreal time."
"How 'bout a serenade?"
"Hmm, maybe I'll ask the First Star for a tuxedo… and some roses."
"I don't want to brag, but I'm somewhat of a cosmic sensation."
"Outshine everyone, and no one will see what you're up to."
"At least the First Star didn't put me in one of those sailor getups."
"The entire universe awaits us."
"If it's not made of stardust, it's not worth the effort."
"I can't believe they talked me into this."
"True Star Guardians never burn out."
"Gotta admit it, the uniform's growing on me."
"And my boots are not waterproof. Fantastic."
"Ugh… Water's cold. AHH! Something touched my foot!"
"'Know your environment.' My environment… is wet and muddy and probably filled with leeches."
"I always know a shortcut."
"This reminds me of discovering the spirit tomb of Ekrin"
"A beaten path is a boring path."
"No way to predict the twists and turns ahead. That's why I wing it!"
"Don't make me put my goggles on. They're decorative."
"Time to show 'em who's best. Spoiler: it's me."
"Yuuto says you're ugly. I agree."
"Oh, a little girl! There's gotta be a twist. *gasp* It's the teddy bear, isn't it?!"
"Hey, Ashe. I totally meant to return that Avarosan sculpture thingy. Is that an ice bow? That's a cool ice bow."
"A celestial dragon that throws stars. Well, this is totally normal. I can do this."
"Possession is 9/10ths of the law, Caitlyn. Those pre-Zaunite demon totems are mine fair and square."
"Okay, Camille. Fork over that 
 
Brackern
 Crystal."
"Woo! Strong goggles game, Corki. Keep it up."
"Aw, crap, I opened a mirror dimension again! ...Does my hair really look like that?"
"Giant 
petricite
 gargoyle. So it's gonna be one of those kind of days."
"Hey, brainface, you are why no one likes Yordle inventors."
"Can't manufacture magic in a lab, Jayce. Or good looks, for that matter."
"That mask is not art, Jhin. It's ancient history."
"Nope! I did not sign up for Jinx-level crazy."
"Hey, Lamb… is Wolf friendly?"
"Oh, I've heard of the Black Rose. Nasty reputation... I mean, uh, huge fan!"
"Lucian! It's me... Jarro Lightfeather."
"Don't pretend you didn't see me, Lux. That doesn't work."
"*voice cracking* Hey, Lux! *clears throat* Hey, Lux. What're yah up to later? Let's hang."
"I'm a mage. You're a mage. I'm blond. You're blond. Doesn't it feel like we were made for each other?"
"Hi, honey! Is it too soon to call you honey? It's too soon."
"Pink looks good on you, Lux. I like it."
"Your eyes really do twinkle like starlight."
"Can you forge me a matching gauntlet?"
"Well, you are just terrifying, aren't you, Pyke?"
"So… Rakan. How serious are you and Xayah? Just asking."
"What the heck is that?!"
"Hey, Ryze! Are you still hiding all those dangerous runes in one place? *louder* Should I not yell that?"
"Oh, c'mon! Sivir! I swear, I didn't know I was robbing your family's ossuary!"
"Throw some more rocks, Taliyah! I need targets to shoot!"
"Yeah, I get it. It's tough being handsome. Right, Taric?"
"Well hello, Xayah. You should know that I am pro-Vastayan rights."
"Hey, Xerath! How come you didn't get a cool Ascended animal body?"
"Gahh, I'm too young for you, Zoe. Cradle-robber."
"Zoe, you're ruining my chances with Lux!"
"Oh, cool. Great. They have an Ascended. This should be fun."
"Everyone! Watch your coin purses."
"Darkin? We're gonna need a bigger army."
"Listen, I have met exactly one Demacian I've liked. By the way, has Lux mentioned me at all? Just curious."
"Jarro Lightfeather doesn't do autographs. Sorry."
"Oh, okay, demigods! Well, universe, you seem to want to screw with old Ezreal today!"
"Oh, please, we gotta deal with demigods?! I really need to up my rate."
"Demons? This is a job for Jarro Lightfeather."
"The uglier the monster, the more fun they are to shoot."
"Why is it always about strength with Noxians? How about vulnerability for once?"
"Noxians. I hate these guys."
"Heh! Piltovans! Always think they're the center of the universe."
"Targonians… Hey, ten words or less, what exactly are you guys?"
"Shadow Isles… all that black mist has got to be protecting something really valuable."
"Shurimans. Always thinking I appropriated their cultural heritage. They're not wrong."
"Didn't expect unliving ghouls. Note to self: always expect unliving ghouls."
"Vastaya! Just like in Santangelo's field guide!"
"Yordles. Why'd it have to be Yordles?"
"I'm better than the First Star. Don't tell 
 
Ahri
 I said that."
"Do I wear my gauntlet... or does my gauntlet wear me?"
"Hey there, gauntlet!  How ya doin', buddy?"
"*yawn* Call me when the stakes are higher."
"You belong in a museum!"
"Oh, please, don't die. I can't lose a sidekick. Not again."
"Hey. We can do this! Well, I can do this. You, 50/50."
"Stick with me and you'll be fine. That's not a guarantee, by the way."
"Sick burn… probably? Wasn't listening."
"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What are your weak spots again?"
"There's somewhere else I gotta be. Literally anywhere else."
Ezreal tries to balance an artifact on his index finger, but drops it and barely manages to catch it.
"Ah. Watch this. *short pause* ...We will never speak of this again. Ever."
"This is no time for jokes. Your jokes. My jokes are great."
Ezreal laughs.
Ezreal laughs.
Ezreal laughs.
Ezreal laughs.
"Lot of good mages out there! None of them are this hot."
"Are you not intrigued?"
"Time for a true display of skill."
"Gauntlet, let's clear a path."
"Watch and learn!"
"Blast 'em, gauntlet!"
"No time to waste."
"Hah! I can blink and still not miss."
"Magic? Comin' at you."
"Obstacle, meet gauntlet."
*Ezreal grunts*
*Ezreal grunts*
"Stand back! Let an expert handle this."
"Pick a timestream, kid."
"Hey Garen! How's your sister?"
"Red. That's fitting for you, Jinx."
"This is flirty fighting."
"This is so us! Right, Lux?"
"So, are you busy later?"
"Aim for the legs…"
"Leave Lux alone, Zoe!"
"I'm gonna send you back to… wherever Yordles come from."
"Gawk at this!"
"Marvel at that!"
*Ezreal grunts*
"Heha!"
"Get starstruck!"
"Embrace the cosmic light!"
"Light never dies!"
*Ezreal grunts*
"Nice shot, me. High-five."
"Another day, another bullseye."
"I. Never. Miss. But I have been known to fire a warning shot or two…"
"Must've ricocheted off a cricket or… something…"
"Gauntlet! You're embarrassing me in front of the bad guys!"
"It wasn't a miss. It was a… near-hit."
"That was a, uh… That was a warning shot!"
"I blame the terrain. Totally that rock's fault."
"Yeah!"
*Ezreal grunts*
*Ezreal grunts*
*Ezreal grunts*
*Ezreal grunts*
"Over here!"
"Now I'm here!"
*Ezreal grunts*
*Ezreal grunts*
*Ezreal grunts*
*Ezreal yells*
*Ezreal yells*
*Ezreal yells*
"Name's Ezreal. E-Z-… oh, you're dead."
"And Ezreal is victorious! Ahhh! Yeah!"
"That's what skill feels like. Hurts, doesn't it?"
"Ooo, that looked like it hurt."
"Maybe next time I'll open an eye."
"Can't learn that in a textbook."
"And now, you're cosmic dust!"
"No applause, please. …Okay, maybe just a bit of thunderous acclaim. …A little?"
"Good job, everyone. Let's, uh… Just keep doing whatever you were doing."
"Wow. That escalated quickly!"
"Take five, everyone. I got this."
"Everyone see that? No? Damn! Now I've got to go and do it again!"
"Ooo, I hope that wasn't a world heritage site."
"They just don't make temple traps like they used to."
"I'll come back later and sift through the rubble for artifacts."
"Cool guys never look back at explosions."
"Never act like victory is assured. Even though it probably is."
"That belongs in a museum. …All of this belongs in a museum… I won't say anything."
"If anyone asks, I didn't see any of these priceless artifacts for sale."
"Don't worry, I'm not the magic artifact police. Wait… Are you?"
"Can I get an itemized receipt? My accountant's way too good at his job."
"Nice. You can send the bill to my uncle's museum."
"This is really worth ten times the asking price."
"We mages call this a warlock exit."
"Ancient. Magic. Words."
"Don't attempt anything glorious in my absence."
"Alright, guys. Don't miss me too much."
"Relax. I blindly teleport long distances all the time."
"Whoa. Time out, everyone. Don't continue the fight without me."
A shortened version of "A New Horizon" plays.
*Ezreal groans*
*Ezreal groans in pain*
"Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated."
"I'll be omitting that little mishap from the expedition logs."
"I truly hope nobody saw that."
"Back from the dead? That confirms it. I am a god."
*Ezreal grunts*
*Ezreal grunts*
*Ezreal grunts*
"No problems here!"
"Haha, I'm allergic to caution."
"I'm a professional."
"You're between me and glory."
"I'm not even breaking a sweat."
"Hard work? Not today!"
"All part of the adventure."
"Sounds dangerous. I'm in."
"No luck. All skill."
"I'll handle this."
"No sweat."
"Oh-ho! It is so on."
"I'll make this look easy."
"I'll show you skill!"
"Pulsefire Systems - Online."
"Let's do this."
"This looks like a good spot."
"Let's rewrite some history."
PEARL: "Pulsefire Systems - Online"
"Run a quick analysis for me."
"All systems operational."
"Ooh, a fixer. Time for a little fun."
"No turning back now!"
"All systems charged."
"Sounds apocalyptic. I'm in."
"I'm centuries ahead of them."
"Haha! What's their position?"
"Gimme the coordinates."
"Ooo… grim dark future, huh? Too easy!"
"Ezreal, do you require a map?"
"No."
"I'll make my own future."
"Grim dark future, huh? Nah, it's more of a highly-regimented totalitarian police state."
"Oh, I know where I'm going. 
When
 is a bit fuzzy."
"Time to travel!"
"Adventure is a perk."
"Hmm… Forward or back."
"The past is my playground."
"I went to the future to see if I was still cool. I was."
"Danger? Mystery? Forbidden knowledge? Just a normal day."
"If I obey all the rules, I'll miss all the fun!"
"I'm not going to live by the time travelers code anymore."
"When the future steals your past, you've gotta steal it back."
"Time travel was just an engineering problem."
"The future can be rewritten."
"I collect moments. And things. Sometimes more than once."
"Time is an adventure, if you know when to look."
"Where are the hover-boards?"
"I have all the time I need."
"Living in the past feels pretty good."
"The future can't hold me back!"
"No time to waste."
"Preserve the past? Gotta find it first."
"When you've got this much skill, every shot's a lucky one."
"Try to keep up."
"All I need is skill.… And a little luck."
"An improvised plan keeps everyone on their toes."
"Everybody's lost but me."
"Scanning for lifeforms."
"Temporal Disturbance Detected - It's you, Ezreal."
"The future is growing unstable."
"The time loop will close in 3… 2… 1…"
"All systems nominal."
"Awaiting command input."
"School sucks, I know."
"Are you from Hyper Crystal Dungeon? I'm so good at that game."
"Ooh, do you think I could be an Arclight? I'm like, super worthy. Like, the most worthy."
"Did High Command ever get my apology letter? Tell them it's from… 'Time Guy.'"
"Dude, seriously? I can see your weak point! It's glowing!"
"Hey… Murderbot timeline… Been a while. How are the murderbots?"
"D'you have any silver krakens on you? Ah, no reason. *quietly* I love them."
"Deep Ones, old blood, whatever. I have a hard 'No Eldritch Sea Monster' rule."
"I'm not giving that evil demon mask back! It's my evil demon mask! I stole it fair and square."
"Look. I know you aren't happy with how I destroyed those universes. But I swear, it was an accident!"
"You're telling me crime can be organized? Then what have I been doing!?"
"Oh, wow! Culinary Masters! The number-one cooking show in 50 universes!"
"Nobody devours all of existence on my watch! I live in there!"
"Stay classy, my friend."
"You didn't even check if the dragons were dead? Come on, guys, that's Dragons 101."
"I never pegged Dreadnova as a flat org. Are you hiring?"
"The Elderwood isn't actually that old. Trust me, I've seen elder-er."
"Organic metal is the way of the future. I'm wearing some right now! Never chafes."
"Ha-ha! You 
are
 real! I KNEW IT! I'M NOT CRAZY!"
"Hey, God-King! Both sides are bad!"
"I have so much respect for your species. 
Please
 don't hunt me."
"I love the hextech renaissance. So much art, and culture, and… hextech…"
"Last time I went to your universe, I almost got eaten by a cowboy demon. Good times."
"Card soldiers. Rad."
"Can you put in a good word for me on the Arclight powers thing? I would be AMAZING."
"The mecha universes keep multiplying. And I. Am. Here for it!"
"Oh, I have so many wrestling masks that it's fu- well, maybe not funny. More like obsessive. Yeah, obsessive."
"There's a timeline where the Magelords survived? Then the 
Institute
…"
"So cool! I haven't seen one of these things since the robot wars that killed everybody."
"Spaaaaace!"
"Wait… aren't you dead? Or alive…? Am I dead? Time travel is messed up."
"I'd rather avoid your timeline. Dying nameless and accursed isn't really my style."
"Not really big on reincarnation. I prefer staying alive the first time."
"Loved your work on a primordial universe. Very avant-garde."
*squeals* "Mortal Reminder is my favorite song! Please sign my cannon arm!"
"Can you put a flame paintjob on my suit? Or… is that too much?"
"Somebody pees in the pool. That's a time secret. You can have that one."
"Monster pelts. So retro."
"Quick question: Are you from the 'Robot Rights' or 'Enslave Humanity' part of the timeline?"
"Your company makes amazing smartphones. And you, I guess."
"Ooh! Can I join your game? My character is Jarro Lightfeather, handsome Rogue-Paladin Elf."
"Cheese it! It's the fuzz!"
"In hindsight, nuclear fission probably wasn't the best thing for Zaun to discover."
"Snowball fight!"
"Seasons greetings! …What month is this?"
"In another life, I am a 
 
soccer star
. No, seriously, I'm a huge star in your timeline."
"Hey! Can I join you guys? Like, as a junior Star Guardian! Open offer."
"Is that a real exosuit? …Can I borrow it?"
"I'm more of a movies-based-on-the-books guy, sorry."
"Oooh, candy!"
"I have your action figure! And also a part from your robot. I'm not sorry."
"Other figures sold separately! I'll stop… I'll-uh, I'll stop."
"Nuclear apocalypse gang! Are you still upset with me? You seem… a little upset."
"Oh, gold, huh? Well, this armor's chromium. And maybe some other stuff, not sure."
"The Protectorate? That means 
the League
… no…"
"Did I cause your kingdoms to war? No. Did I help? …Possibly."
"I'm told the Poro King does not banish guests lightly. *nervous chuckle, followed by a heavy sigh*"
"How many worlds can you break? One? More than one? …Two?"
"Quit following me! I'm having time-fun!"
"Do you really worship time? That's weird even by my standards."
"Paradox Warlord isn't your usual style, Shen. Cool name though."
"We are nothing alike. You're a time thief. I'm a time adventurer."
*Ezreal imitates a guitar riff* ♫"What even is this armor, yeah!"♫
♫"Doo-doo-doot-doo! Forward in time! Backward in time! Always on… whoosh, time."♫
♫"Jumpin' through time! Arm is a gun! Everybody loves me!"♫

"Hey, what's the scanner say about their power level?"
"No enemies display a power level over 9000."
"Hehe, thought so."
"I've got nothing but time! Let's go!"
"No, 
you
 belong in a museum!"
"Get lost, kid!"
"Wanna start over? I can wait."
"I knew you'd say that."
"Yeah, yeah. Everyone wants a piece of me."
Ezreal prepares to fire his weapon, but it malfunctions and shoots him in the face.
"Time for a true display of ski-"
"Systems offline."
"Argh!"
"Recharging."
"Just a sec… Argh!"
"There's no match for Ez-"
"Systems offline."
"Hey, wait, no, don't…!"

"All charged up!"
"Weapons hot!"
"The future's really more of a backup plan."
"No one owns history!"
"The future is arbitrary."
"Don't blink."
"My greatest discovery? More time!"
"This'll be memorable… for me."
"Say hello to the future!"
"Of all my travels, time travel is the best!"
"This is what I call archaeology!"
"Nothing surprises me. I'm a scientist."
"Can't learn this in a book."
"Now this is research!"
"Sounds dangerous - I'm in!"
"Time to get our hands dirty."
"Throwing down the time gauntlet."
"How 'bout a taste of the future?"
"The past is like a punch to the face."
"Oh, yeah. This is totally for science."
"The future hurts, doesn't it?"
"Jump first, ask questions later."
"I love the smell of chronoshifting."
"Bending space-time isn't as hard as it looks."
"Engaging temporal weapon systems."
"Diverting all power to weapons."
"The energy blasts… tickle."

"A possible side effect of time travel is acting before thinking."
"All systems operational."
"Pulsefire Systems - Online"
"Well, you found me. Congratulations."
"Oh! I suppose you're a genius, too."
"Paradox fight!"
"Have I been working out? Oh, no. That's the armor."
"Are we upgrading? Ooo, what if I get an itch?"
"This isn't even my final form! It's my second one."
"All of my awesome, none of my weaknesses."
"Systems Upgraded."
"Power nearing full capacity."
"Nice upgrade, PEARL! Very chic."

"Note to your future self: Don't die."
"Can't really fight the future."
"Chrono-dimensional travel isn't for everybody."
"You can thank me for your future later."
"Nice try."
"What can I say? I'm gifted."
"Time is a construct. I'm just doing a little remodeling."
"This would be dangerous if I wasn't doing it."
"They're always asking such dumb questions. It's a magic time crystal, DUHHH."
"To hell with the general, I'm special relativity!"
"Talent breeds envy. I'm used to it."
"I've got this space-time on lock."
"Guess your future was on my side."
"Seeya later! …Just kidding."
"Here's a prediction from the future: You're dead!"
"Let's do that again."
"Timing really is everything."
"Hope someone saw that."
"I can blink and still not miss."
"You can't learn this in a book."
"I'm a one-shot hero!"
"Back to the future with you!"
"Had to carpe diem, officer."
"You lost today, kid."
"There can be only one!"
"Not another time loop!"
"Paradoxes. I hate those guys."
"Damn, I'm handsome in every timeline."
"I had a dog once. I loved that dog."
"Don't everybody thank me at once!"
"Tell me the odds, I dare you!"
"He who controls the past wins!"
"Yup, that was pretty amazing! Even for a time wizard like myself."
"Ho-ho! I might want to jump back and do that again!"
"Whoa! That was 
way
 easier than fighting those dinosaurs. Wait, you don't remember the dinosaurs? *chuckles* Yeah, of course you don't."
"How retro."
"I'll take one of these."
"This looks good."
"Don't mind if I do."
"It's not a vacation if I can't pick up a few souvenirs."
"Museum? This belongs in my pocket."
"Time for a little fortune and glory."
"Ooh, scouting reticle upgrade! Nice."
"Hmm… Tasty."
"Woot!"
"Obstacles tend to fall when I'm around."
"That was simple."
"A map? No thanks. Chronology protection point? Yes, please."

"Leaving the grid."
"Withdrawing."

"Why regret the past when you can change it?"
"How 'bout a temporal do-over?"
"Woohoo!"
"Woo! Nice to be back!"
"Alright, just one more time."
"Professor Graves wouldn't be happy with me fighting outside of school, but he doesn't have to know."
"No holding back. Time to show everybody what I can do!"
"Our opponents are ready for a fight! Perfect, I'll finally get to go all out!"
"No more messing around!"
"Now it's my turn!"
"There's no going back!"
"I won't waste this chance!"
"Remember your lessons: focus, then attack!"
"There are a lot of heroes out there, but none like me."
"Durandal City is counting on me! I won't let it down."
"Let's give these powers a test drive!"
"Everyone's working so hard, I won't let them down!"
"Real combat is a lot different than I imagined."
"I won't let anything stand in my way!"
"Real combat! What a rush!"
"I wonder how strong my teammates are? I should ask them to train with me later!"
"Oh no, is there a test tomorrow?!"
"Am I really strong enough?"
"Why didn't I eat before I got here?! Ezreal, WHY?!"
"I'm going to be a great hero someday!"
"I wonder what else this gauntlet is good for."
"Gotta think of a cool attack name!"
"Guess I'll have to figure out what it means to be strong."
"Training is important, but a little fun never hurt anybody!"
"The enemy won't go easy on me. I need to focus!"
"I wonder what the rest of the class is doing."
"I haven't lost yet."
"Someday, I'll make these powers my own."
"I was lucky to get into the academy, I can't let the school down."
"Alright Ezreal, stay calm! And rely on your senses! These abilities are still unstable."
"Crimson Dynamite..! No, not that… Crimson RUIN?! Ugh, I suck at naming attacks."
"This place is on a whole other level! No more training wheels, I guess."
"Were our powers really inherited from the god-weapons?
"Once I master these powers, nothing will stop me from realizing my dreams!"
"This better not make me late for class. I've got 12 tardies, and we're only 10 days into the semester!"
"The second years are a lot stronger than us. But with the right training, we can surpass them!"
"Katarina is one of the academies top students.. why is she fighting me?
"Principal Yuumi? That's not good. I don't wanna get expelled!"
"I'm sparring with Lux? W-what do I do? Do I fight her? We have a date later!"
"That looks like a Star Guardian from those old comic books! Wait… are they real?"
"Professor Graves must be testing me again. Then this time, I'm going to pass!"
"Everyone looks up to Jayce as class president. If I can beat him, maybe they'll see me the same way!"
"What? A MECH? And it's SHOOTING FIRE?! You've gotta be kidding!"
Ezreal charges up his weapon and lets out a yell.
"You ready?" (yells)
"Watch this!" (yells)
Ezreal yells.
Ezreal yells.
Ezreal yells.
Ezreal yells.
"Are you all talk? C'mon, let's do this!"
Ezreal pulls out his phone and exchanges texts with 
 
Lux
.
"And who might this be?"
"Ooh, a text!"
"Maybe you should focus on the mission."
Ezreal laughs.
Ezreal laughs.
Ezreal laughs.
"Now you're in for it!"
"Nice!"
"I've broken past my limits!"
"That's it! Full power!"
"Time to get serious!"
"This ends here!"
"Alright!"
"I'm going all out!"
"Don't think I'll make this easy!"
"Everyone's counting on me."
"I won't let my friends down!"
"This is what I've trained for!"
"See if you can keep up."
"Let's settle this!"
"I'll never give up!"
"You don't stand a chance!"
"Just a little more!"
"A blind spot!"
"You're really not letting up."
"I won't hold back!"
"Let's end this quick!"
"Here goes everything!"
"If I can just get close!"
"I'm your next opponent!"
"You don't scare me!"
"Whatever your powers are, I'll beat them!"
"Don't underestimate my power!"
"You better not go easy on me!"
"You've got some good moves!"
"I can see through your attacks!"
"Now's my chance to finish this."
"I'll never lose to someone like you!"
"Strike first!"
"Class is in session!"
"You're not paying attention."
"I'll never forgive you!"
"I never back down from a fight!"
"I'll never lose to someone like you!"
Ezreal grunts.
Ezreal grunts.
Ezreal grunts.
Ezreal grunts.
Ezreal grunts.
Ezreal grunts.
"Hey, Jayce! I'm Ezreal. Remember the name."
"Madam Principal, I'll fight you if I have to!"
"Don't hold back, Lux!"
"I'm stronger than you think, Professor Graves!"
"We don't have to be enemies, Katarina!"
"Mystic shot!"
"Quit messing around!"
"This is my power!"
"You let your guard down!"
"I'll end this now!"
"See if you can handle this!"
"Now's my chance!"
"Eat THIS."
"An opening!"
"Hah!"
"HAH!"
"They're fast!"
"Oh no!"
"No way!"
"You can't dodge forever!"
"I don't believe it!"
"They dodged my attack?"
"What? I missed?!"
"Next time, I won't miss."
"I hope this works!"
"Crimson Cobalt!"
"CRIMSON COBALT!"
"IT'S OVER!"
"MY ULTIMATE ATTACK!"
"CRIMSON COBALT!"
"If I can beat Professor Graves, how strong can I become?"
"I'm sorry, Principal Yuumi! Please don't destroy another dormitory!"
"I'm sorry, Lux…. I love youUUAAAH! I didn't say that!"
"I defeated Jayce! Does that mean I can be strong too?"
"Was Katarina holding back? Did she… let me win?"
"Is this the power of the god-weapon Durandal?!"
"You were strong. Let's fight again sometime!"
"I may have won, but I still have a long way to go!"
"Am I getting stronger? My training paid off!"
"Haha! Looks like you overdid it!"
"I'm young, but that doesn't mean I'm weak!"
"Next time, come at me with everything you've got!"
"I'll graduate from the academy, and protect everybody!"
"I knew Lux used the power of light, but that was unbelievable!"
"Wow, Jayce is so strong! One day, I know I'll catch up to him!"
"Katarina, you don't have to fight alone!"
"Woah! Professor Graves blew them away like it was nothing!"
"Principal Yuumi magic is so… magical."
"I don't have to fix those, do I?"
Ezreal grunts.
"Piece of cake."
"How do you like that?"
Ezreal grunts.
"Hyah!"
"I wasn't strong enough?"
"I'm sorry… everyone…"
"Whoops! Guess I got a little careless. I better stop messing around."
"So that's how it is, huh? Then this time I'll fight for real."
"Ouch! Guess I got carried away!"
"One more mission, one step closer to the Sorceress. Hope she's ready."
"We got this. Chin up, claws out."
"I wasn't anyone's first choice to save the world. But I'm not the wrong one."
"People have no idea that spirits and magic exists. I didn't, but it's everywhere. If you know where to look."
"One evil Sorceress versus a team of mystical warriors, and an ancient tiger spirit. I'll take those odds."
"Some one's got to protect the protectors. I'll make sure we all get out of this in one piece."
"Everything's got a spirit. The grass, the river, the- ow! Rock in my shoe."
"The Sorceress is my fault. I won't let anything bad happen to the team because of my stupid mistake."
"Keeping precious artifacts out of the wrong hands is my duty. The Sorceress, definitely the wrong hands."
"Focus on the now, for now. Think about what comes next once we, you know, save the world."
"I used to do everything alone. My research, my thesis, my life... Having friends is nice."
"Sometimes, stories are just stories. Other times, you wind up fighting evil with a magic tiger."
"Hey, Amumu. If I make you laugh, will tea pour out of your nose?"
"Oh, Lamb! Can Stripes play with Wolf after this?"
"I put you back together, Lissandra. But now, I'm going to take you apart."
"Lux. You saved me once. Now's my turn to save you."
"Porcelain fight? Bring it."
"Did that intimidate you, Stripes? No? Me neither."
"I've heard fresher material from a three-thousand year-old tiger spirit."
"And not a scratch on me."
"Now that's some fine art!"
"Whose fragile now?"
"Did I shatter your expectations?"
"Sending your spirit back where it belongs!"
"And stay away from my friends."
"I'm kilning it- Kilning i- Ah, we'll workshop it."
"Don't talk to me or my tiger spirit ever again."
"Simple and clean."
"Alright, whose next?"
"Back to saving the world."
"This team's under my protection."
"Ooh, that might leave a chip. Sorry little guy."
Kindreds going to be so mad when they come back.""
"Wait, she's down? She's down! Ha ha! Buh-bye evil Sorceress!"
"I don't know what happened to you, Lux, but I'll fix it. Promise."
"Anyone got a broom?"
Stripes roars
Ezreal tries to mimic Stripes (coughs) "I'll leave the victory roar to you."
"Thought I'd end up in pieces."
"Okay. Time to dust off and try again."
"Let's not make a pattern out of this."
"Ready for the best?"
"GG"
"I let you guys off easy!"
"Snakes, why did it have to be snakes?"
"Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards."
"That escalated quickly."
"This belongs in a museum. - So do you." ; "Nazis... I hate these guys... "
"In the grim darkness of a far future, there is only war"
"Now this is Podracing!"
"If I'm not back in five minutes… just wait longer."
"You lost today, Kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it" ;
"Everybody's lost but me."
 "Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory."
"I have all the time in the world"
