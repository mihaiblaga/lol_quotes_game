"Dead man walkin'."
"End of the line."
"I've got no time for games."
"What are you playin' at?"
"Feelin' lucky?"
"Try me."
"Easy, partner."
"Got any bright ideas?"
"Always trouble."
"Let's settle the score."
"I ain't got time to bleed."
"Don't die, yet! Heh, that was only a warning shot."
"Hope you weren't planning to die of natural causes."
"I like my enemies two ways: dead, or about to be."
"Everyone's a hero... till you shoot off a leg or two."
"Go ahead! I like moving targets."
"This is gonna tickle."
"They picked the wrong fight."
"Think I'm bluffin'?"
"Like fish in a barrel."
"End of the line."
"Lights out."
"Lights out!"
"All in."
"Bettin' blind."
"Bettin' blind!"
"Night night."
"Night night!"
"Who's in the dark now?"
"I've got your darkness."
"Aah...  tarnation... "
"Sentinel Graves here, doing hero stuff, and... aw screw it. I'm robbin' everybody!"
"I fight on the side of the light. And ya know what catches light? Gold. Everybody, empty yer pockets."
"The best part of being a hero, is holding someone up at gunpoint in a dark alley. Or, no, wait, let me try that again."
"I wouldn't piss on any of y'all if you was on fire. C'ept for you, Vayne. You tried to kill me, so... I respect ya."
"Hey, Vayne. Are you a cigar woman? I got some extras. They smell, but, y'know, friends can share a nice cigar."
"I'm so handsome and stunning. But in a down to earth accessible way."
"They better build a statue of me after this. A real discreet one y'know, with the face all messed up."
"When a man loves crime, there ain't nobody who can stop him. 'Cept the police. That's their whole thing."
"I bathe at semi-regular intervals! You can't prove otherwise! Nobody smell me!"
"My partner's around here somewhere, I think. Tobias? Ah, who cares."
"The Sentinels are alright. A little desperate, and confused, and sad. Oh god, what did I agree to?!"
"'Join the Sentinels! Save the world from evil!' Heh. Last time I trust a woman who can turn into a ghost."
"Bilgewater's fine. Ghost murder is a fun change of pace from all the regular murder."
"I haven't stolen one damn thing since this Ruined King started Harrowin' everybody. I hate it."
"So, the man ghost is evil, and the lady ghost is his wife? Well, why'd she marry him? That guy sucks."
"Hey there, scissors. Or, uh... Isolde? This whole thing confuses me."
"Oh no, I ain't fallin' for yer sea priestess tentacle magic. Not a fourth time!"
"Hey, Lucian. You ever look at Viego and think, 'What a terrifyin' parallel to me?"
"More trainin', Senna? I already took a bath. What more do you want?!"
"Tobias, what the hell you doin' over there?! Get back here!"
"We're buddies now, Vayne! Yer never gettin' rid of me!"
"Still looking for pieces of yer dead wife? You dumb, green, shirtless idiot."
"Yorick, that ghost lady you drag around is terrifyin'. What the hell, man?!"
"Hey moon lady, is there a sun lady? Are y'all friends? Oh, I see."
"I had a dream we fought one, Draven. You got murdered by my buddy, Rango."
"Not for nothing, Irelia, but uh... those blades worth anything?"
"Well, this bodes ill for all of Ionia. Not me, though. I'm doing great."
"Missy Fortune, I have had it up to here with all yer dirty double crossin'!"
"I can respect a large musky barbarian who knows what he wants."
"Atreus? Oh, you ain't Atreus anymore, are ya?"
"So, Illaoi's magic couldn't hold. Sorry Pyke, gotta put ya down."
"Hey, Rango. You carry cash on ya, or just meat and heads and stuff?"
"Doing a crime ain't that bad, Riven. Oh, war crimes? Yeah, that's bad."
"I always wanted to rob a mind-controlled shapeshiftin' dragon."
"Hey, it's my good friend Vayne! And she looks... pissed? Uh oh."
"I'm wearing the Sentinel colors, but that don't mean I won't blow yer head off."
"Hah! Yer funny. Shame I'll have to rob ya later."
"I demand the respect I refuse to show to anybody."
"Hoo! That one had some mustard on it."
"Unregistered illegal firearms. Gets 'em every time."
"I'm gonna rifle through yer pockets now, and it might get weird."
"Sure, I rob and murder, but counterpoint, I robbed and murdered ya."
"Aw it ain't so bad. I didn't even have a good reason to kill ya."
"This is me savin' the world! What a non-criminal act I have just committed!"
"I might be a Sentinel, but that don't make me a good man."
"If I'm the hero, then do laws count? Prob'ly not."
"Like shootin' a ghoul, in a ghoul barrel? Eh, I'll think of a better one."
"Sorry, scissors. Try not to take it personal."
"I respect the Sentinels, Lucian, but not that much."
"I'll rob anybody, Senna. Hell, I'll rob ya twice if ya let me."
"Vayne? Buddy? Oh, god, she's gonna be mad."
"Isolde don't even like you anymore! You big, sad, ghost baby!"
"To yer credit Missy Fortune, Viego was a damn good mark."
"Yeah, yeah I cut yer line. Shut yer damn ghost mouth!"
"Are we still hangin' out after this? I assume we are."
"I knew we'd be buddies, Vayne!"
"Thanks, Vayne! Yer my accomplice."
"Alright, Vayne! She's my friend. We're friends."
"That's right, I'm a big damn hero! And I took all yer money, so I'm a rich one too!"
"What the hell was that?! Was I dead? I didn't even go to crime heaven!"
"Did I die in a cool way? Don't tell me. Imma say I did."
"Death really puts things in perspective. I gotta rob more people."
"Nope. Don't like bein' dead. Not my favorite. Wouldn't recommend it."
"I saw the faces of everyone I every owed money! Oh, sweet Tommy Kench"
"This calls for the ol' double-barreled 'hello'."
"Well, well, it's time I straightened you out, Fate... "
"GG!"
"End of the line."
"You've gotta ask yourself one question; do I feel lucky? Well do ya, punk?"
"Ciemność widzę"
"I see darkness"
"Zawsze sikasz przez zapięty rozporek?"
"You always pee with the slit closed?"
"W imię zasad"
"In the name of the rules"
"Co Ty wiesz o zabijaniu?"
"What do you know about killing people?"
"Wyrwałem chwasta"
"I pulled out the weed"
