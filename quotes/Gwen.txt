"Head high, chin up, scissors ready!"
"Why not? My scissors don't bite."
"What a strange, wonderful world. I must make sure it stays that way."
"Back when I was a doll, I really wanted to fight. This is my chance, my only one."
"Alright everyone. First, we must win. After, I'll be glad to fix any clothes, hair, or broken spirits."
"Scissors, needles, thread; tools of Isolde. She'll always be with me, and I with her."
"I've certainly endured far worse than this."
"Still can't believe I get to move my hands and feet all on my own!"
"These turrets look strong, it'll be quite fun cutting them down!"
"I'll make sure my allies feel the joy they deserve!"
"I'll break as many needles as it takes to get this right."
"I sense their resolve. No matter, mine will be stronger."
"Don't waste a minute!"
"I must hurry if I am to win."
"Ahh, that brisk, fresh air!"
"No time like the present!"
"The memories I stitch here will be my own."
"I've got to make each footprint mean something."
"The wind at my back feels so good. I can't lose this. I won't."
"What happens next, I get to decide!"
"The Black Mist won't hurt anyone. I promise."
"They're trying to stop me. Well, they can keep on trying!"
"If only she were here to see this... see me."
"I will experience everything like I never could before!"
"The struggle is worth it."
"Onward!"
"This is better than a dream. It's real, and I won't ever forget it!"
"Oh, what to do!"
"No one said life would be easy. That is its charm, to be sure."
"Seeing my dress twirl reminds me to smile."
"Isolde. Wherever you are, I know you'll be alright."
"Bits of fabric can become something beautiful. My work here can do just the same!"
"I remember when she sewed my dress with these scissors. Now, they cut a different cloth."
"Oh, are those mountains beyond the cliffs? I've always wished to see one up close!"
"It's called the Hallowed Mist, but how it feels matters more. Warm, safe, like nothing can hurt me."
"This place certainly brings out the fight in everyone. Wouldn't be fair if I didn't present my best."
"Akshan, you've made the sentinels proud. Don't let them down."
"Irelia, you saved the land. It's an honor to cross blades."
"Lucian, quite the journey we had. Are you still a good shot?"
"You seem happy, Lux, but you know pain too. Why deny it?"
"A talking mountain. Now, what shall I say to you when you fall?"
"Olaf, my friend. Still looking for a glorious death?"
"A giant ram who sharpens scissors. Why... dreams do come true!"
"Riven. A little thread and that blade will be as good as new."
"Senna, you have Mist too! But it's not all good, not all bad... how strange."
"A stage, a voice, is that really all you are?"
"Thresh, no matter your form, I've faced you once. I'll do it again."
"Sentinel, maybe the world would look better without those dark glasses."
"Vex, you can be happy for the right reasons. I'll prove it."
"Viego. You never deserved love. Especially not hers."
"Yasuo, your clothes are truly terrible."
"Please take care of the maiden... or I won't go easy on you."
"I heard something. 'You are bad!' They said it, not me."
"How sad, you must be broken on the inside."
"Just like the good old times. Sweet, simple, and out of control!"
"Bad jokes are a waste of life!"
"Oh, joy!"
"Looking for a tailor?"
"Whatever it takes!"
"This'll cheer me up!"
"Most terrific!"
"What a delight!"
"How fun!"
"With pleasure!"
"I run with scissors!"
"A few quick cuts!"
"Pure bliss!"
"Cut fast, cut strong!"
"Here's a sewing trick!"
"A great day to fight!"
"May I jump in?"
"No loose threads!"
"Alright, my turn!"
"Ready as I'll ever be!"
"Marvelous!"
"I needn't hold back."
"You don't frighten me!"
"To shreds!"
"Cut through!"
"Snip snip!"
"To pieces!"
"Hallowed protection."
"Safe and sound."
"Blessed mist!"
"Hide and seek."
"With haste!"
"I'm gone!"
"Promptly!"
"Quick quick!"
"Needles out!"
"Go!"
"Enough!"
"Out of my way!"
"She's still with me!"
"Pin them down!"
"No stitching that back together."
"No time to rest."
"I feel so alive!"
"I won't let you hurt anyone!"
"Another down, I'm getting good."
"Try again! I dare you!"
"Ha, how foolish!"
"She'd be proud."
"I did that! Me!"
"I know your tricks, Akshan. Do better."
"Irelia, that wasn't the hero who saved the land."
"Good try, Lucian. I'll tell Senna you got me good."
"No running from pain, Lux. Next time, shine through it."
"Ha! And they say scissors can't beat rock!"
"You're most welcome, Olaf. I promised you'd die with glory."
"Mr. Ornn, are you still there? Are you asleep?"
"Riven, I fought alongside a stronger you. Show me her."
"Please, Senna. Don't hold back. I've seen your strength."
"A pretty voice, Seraphine. What a shame that's all you were."
"I suppose you didn't plan for that. How unlike you, Thresh."
"Vayne, you're a sentinel. I'd expect more."
"Vex, next time give joy a chance."
"She pitied you. I never did."
"Oh! The wind feels nice again."
"Don't worry, I'll show the maiden how to smile."
"Haha, five in a row! What an absolute joy!"
"Off we go, scissors!"
"I learned this trick back home, and added my own misty touch!"
"Hold on, I need to grab more supplies! Don't start a fight without me!"
"I can fight...! I must..."
"No!"
"Just... a few more breaths..."
"Not yet! I promised..."
"Ugh, I can't give up! Not now, not ever!"
"Oh? I thought I was lost, but I'm still here. I'm still alive!"
"Ugh, I can do this! For her, and for everyone!"
