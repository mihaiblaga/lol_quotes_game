"Soon."
"Come closer."
"Such a busy world."
"Just a harmless flower."
"Take careful steps."
"So much more to see."
"The forest holds many surprises."
"A promising garden."
"Things aren't always what they seem."
"Wait until my seeds take root."
"Venture off the beaten path."
"This land is mine!"
"No place is safe while I'm free!"
"Our seasons are reversed: my spring, your fall."
"Where are your friends? Mine are all around."
"Death is in bloom."
"Choke the life from them."
"The harvest is upon us."
"My prey thinks itself clever."
"What lurks beneath the soil?"
"None will escape my grasp!"
"Pierce!"
"Bloom!"
"Sprout!"
"Burst!"
"Soon."
"Be ready."
"Just wait."
"Live."
"Barbs!"
"Whip vine!"
"Briar!"
"Lash!"
"Watch your step, this is  my  garden."
"GG!"
"This harvest is yours."
"This world is mine"
