"Your will, my hands."
"I return to my training."
"Many monks live in peace.  I do not envy them."
"The weight of this power, it will not hold me back."
"My sight may be gone, but my vision holds true."
"I will struggle, I will fail, but to surrender is a privilege I do not have."
"A fight to the bitter end. I welcome this opportunity."
"Quiet steps."
"Extend your senses."
"Where am I needed?"
"Find your center."
"I will atone."
"Master yourself, master the enemy."
"Waste not a minute."
"We do what we must."
"Endless trials await."
"Only I can endure the dragon's fury."
"My journey led me here."
"Today will be a worthy test."
"My fists are my weapons."
"The dragon answers in flame."
"Never again will arrogance lead me astray."
"My training left more scars than any battle."
"I need no blade to strike down my foes."
"I bloodied my knuckles to sharpen my fists."
"I must stay disciplined."
"I will master the dragon's spirit, or die trying."
"Enlightenment is knowing the value of one's ignorance."
"The dragon blazed my trail. I merely walk it."
"The monks taught me well, but I determine my own fate."
"Ionia prayed for peace. What fools we were to think it possible."
"The dragon must be unleashed, or it will consume me from within."
"Those who do not know their limits will never reach their potential."
"The spirits live among us; their power echoes throughout the land."
"They see only a blind man.  I will open their eyes."
"I did not blind myself. I called upon the dragon, and suffered its wrath."
"The dragon spirit is not magic; it is life, more ancient than ours."
"The marks on my body are not warnings; they are reminders of the burden I bear."
"You are but a gilded reflection of what dragons truly are."
"You won a great victory, Irelia. I look forward to besting you in combat."
"Kayn, you bear powers you cannot hope to master. Stop, before it is too late."
"Draw your blade, Master Yi. I have waited long to face you."
"Shyvana, your spirit seems divided... and familiar."
"Old friend, I sense the spirits fighting within you still."
"Wukong, someone of your skill ought to listen to his master."
"Xin Zhao, or would you rather fight under your other name?"
"You say death is like the wind. Shall we see which way it blows?"
"Even in the bitter cold, your spirit burns. How admirable."
"Before, we were one spirit. What have we become?"
"I am the fire of Shojin. Face me with all your strength."
"Force is meaningless without skill."
"You have not earned victory this day."
"Let us see whose spirit is stronger."
"Blindness is no impairment against a smelly enemy."
"Our foes are not much to look at."
"Enough blind jokes. Stop asking for more."
"I fail to see the humor in that."
Lee Sin laughs.

"Strike firmly!"
"Their heartbeats quicken."
"Worry not."
"I'll see this through."
"Act free of doubt."
"Your weakness is revealed!"
"Fear clouds your mind."
"Come, test your convictions."
"You dare doubt my resolve?"
"Your skill against mine."
"I do not teach, I demonstrate."
"Break beneath my fists."
"You hesitate."
"I will crush body and spirit."
"A flaw in your technique."
"You upset my balance."
"Speed becomes force."
"Beware the dragon spirit!"
"A risk I shall take!"
"Your spirit trembles."
"Hikuh!"
"Hikuh!"
"Hikuh!"
"Hikuh!"
"Tong!"

"Behold!"
"Hikuh!"
"Hikuh!"
"Hikuh!"
"May your spirit find peace."
"Your journey has reached its conclusion."
"Hmph, rethink your approach."
"I do not give second chances."
"That mistake proved your undoing."
"Mercy is no kindness."
"My training granted me this victory."
"You had the confidence, but not the skill."
"Expand too far, and you lose your center."
"The land will remember you, Irelia."
"Kayn, neither path would have given you what you truly desired."
"Do not worry, Wuju lives on in another."
"Rest, Shyvana. Demacia is not ready to embrace your kind."
"Udyr, your rage was beyond your own control."
"Wukong, return to your master.  You still have much to learn."
"Kings and walls have eroded your form, Xin Zhao."
"The wind has come for you, Yasuo."
"Your technique reminds me of your home: fierce, but untamed."
"We shared the same home, but not the same beliefs."
"Send me more Noxians. I have yet to unleash all my power."
"Five have fallen before me!  Let me challenge five more!"
"Stand up! My training is not yet finished!"
"My spirit rests."
"I return to my meditations."
"The dragon sleeps, for now."
"Goal!"
"I... was not... worthy..."
"Dragon spirit... I've failed you."
"My final lesson..."
Lee sin groans.
Lee sin groans.
Lee sin groans.
Lee Sin grunts.
"I shall not repeat that mistake."
"Failure has not stopped me before.  It will not now."
"The dragon spirit offers me another chance."
"I search for a worthy opponent."
"The first step to transcendence."
"They fear my approach. They will flee before me."
"They will die by my hands."
"They dare to challenge a god? Let them try."
"They will tremble in awe."
"Today's triumph will feed the fire in my soul."
"Let them come."
"A thousand battles, a thousand victories."
"I will conquer like the flame. All will fall to ash before me."
"Each battle brings me one step closer to perfection."
"Mortal fear is irrelevant."
"The mark I leave will last an eternity."
"I will test the limits of my divinity."
"I am the fiery hand of the heavens."
"I move with purpose."
"I see all."
"With certainty."
"Perfection is near. It will be mine."
"I expect nothing but perfection."
"I will crush this world."
"Godhood is mine alone."
"My might echoes like thunder."
"The world is power. The world is force."
"They flee at my approach."
"The fire of true divinity is glorious."
"They will tremble in awe."
"Celestial fire courses through my veins."
"Mortal sight, but it will suffice."
"Vision worthy of a god."
"Come closer so you may witness my divine power."
"Let us fight. Even the patience of a god has limits."
"Return to your home and raise your future failures."
"Immortality is a gift you do not possess."
"You have gained no enlightenment in death."
"Come and say that to my fist."
"I hold myself to a higher standard."
"You taunt a god?" Lee Sin laughs.
Lee Sin kicks the air rapidly, and accidentally sets his foot on fire.
"Divinity can be an extreme fire hazard."
"Just wait until I reach super ultimate god level tier."
"This world is beneath me. Literally."
"You seek to amuse a god? You have failed."
"You make a joke in the face of your destruction? That is funny."
Lee Sin laughs.

"You lack conviction."
"If you believe yourself worthy, fight."
"Your confidence is no substitute for skill."
Lee Sin laughs. "I am not a man, I am a god."
"You will fall before my divinity."
"Even a blind man can see your weakness."
"Your soul has already given up."
"A challenge!"
"Admitting your limits is the first step to failure."
"Only the best will be legends."
"Adapt and learn, or perish."
"You waste my time."
"I will prevail, and you will die."
"Approach and be tested."
"Perfection."
"This is truth."
"Feel the might of the heavens."
"I consider retreat an insult."
"The first truth is pain. There are no other truths."
"These fists have crushed mountains."
"I demand excellence."
"You lack discipline."
"Your flawed training betrays you."
"I will reveal your limitations."
"Kneel before your god."
"My victory is inevitable."
"You. Will. Kneel!"
"I grow tired of your weakness."
"The earth will tremble."
"You cannot escape."
"Fall before me."
"Behold the power of a god."
"Can you hear my fists?"
"You must be quicker!"
"I have mastered speed as well."
"A blade of grass stands in my path."
"Your skill is lacking."
"You are... a disappointment."
"Train, and one day you may achieve my greatness."
"A spirit brother?"
"You too will fall before me."
"You will be a stepping stone to my greatness."
"Finally, a challenge!"
"Flawless."
"That was too easy."
"It's not arrogance if your skill is unmatched."
"They will witness my power."
"Mortals are so fragile."

"Do not worry, death builds character."
"Your failure is proof that I am superior."
"I take no pleasure in besting the weak."
"I saw your mistakes all too clearly."
"You were... unremarkable."
"Consider yourself honored."
"Excellence is not for everyone."
"You lacked confidence."
"You were unworthy."
"Feeble!"
"Disappointing."
"Such a meager fight. I am hungry for more."
"Inferior."
"Inadequate."
"Too easy."
"The key to immortality? Being better than everyone else."
"True divinity shows no mercy."
"You may weep in the next life."
"I accept your failure."
"My form was beyond your comprehension."
"From nothing, became nothing, is nothing once more."
"Courage is not enough."
"My will is magnificent."
"Witness the might of the heavens."
"There is no running from a god."
"Pathetic!"
"Not even close."
"Not cunning enough, little fox."
"You hesitated."
"Even a star dragon is no match for a god."
"The symphony of heaven is the sound of my fist."
"Your god has abandoned you."
"Your strategy has fallen before my fists."
"Better to be a warrior in the garden than a gardener in war."
"Uninspired."
"Ionia's spirit is now mine."
"Your final moment is at hand."
"All the lesser spirits will fall before me."
"He who conquers himself is the mightiest warrior."
"I will meditate on your insignificance."
"Easy prey."
"There is no challenge in a broken spirit."
"You were... out of balance."
"Even unleashed, your power was limited."
"A lesser spirit consumed by hunger."
"All those souls and not enough to save you."
"Your instincts have failed you."
"Crude power and no technique."
"More a whimper than a roar."
"You have failed your test."
"Your fate has been decided."
"Nothing but a shadow."
"Is it victory if there's no challenge?"
"Your sacrifice pleases me."
"Will no one rise to my challenge?"
"Your prayers have been answered."
"If you do not fight, you have already lost."
"They are so fragile."
"God-like? Ha! I 
am
 a god."
"I need no weapon, 
I
 am the weapon."
"I am hungry for a challenge."
"Is no one here my better?"
"Order has returned."
"Their bones are weak."
Lee Sin laughs.
"The first of many."
"Such feeble will."
"It falls easier than a child's toy."
"I will tear them down, stone by stone."
"It is their will I crush."
"Everything flows from mastering the task at hand."
"I will break them, one bone at a time."
"It is mine."
"They crumble before me."
"As I will it."
"I am appeased, for the moment."
"What mortal trinkets."
"This will do."
"An offering for the gods."
"Quickness is the essence of victory."
"It tastes like their tears."
"Nectar. Ambrosia. Tasty."
"Fighting makes even a god thristy."
"My eyes will be everywhere."
"A god is aware of all things."
"I see endless opportunity."
"Vision allows perfection."
"I see future opportunities."
"Awareness is a state of mind."
"Seeing with your eyes is for mortals."
"I am all-seeing."
"Omniscience."
"My third eye sees all."
"Endless opportunity."
"There is no hiding from a god."
"I will witness their cowardice."
"Foresight is true knowledge."
"A mortal house is so easily entered."
"Sight is useless to those without vision."
"Vision is for the worthy."
"Their vision was unworthy."
"Their sight is no match for mine."
"Await my return."
"A true victor knows when to engage."
"Another time."
"Death only frightens the timid."
"Death is beneath me..."
"I do not fear death, only mediocrity."
"I will return."
"I did not see that coming."
"Divinity cannot be constrained."
"Divine fire burns from within."
"Skill must be tested."
"I will bring a storm of justice. Surrender, and be spared."
"No one can withstand the storm, or his chosen one."
"I will unleash the Storm Dragon's wrath. Hikuh!"
"With the dragons' blessings, we will be victorious!"
"Villainous dragonmancers, you dishonor your power."
"My thunderous fists strike down all villainy!"
"No villain can withstand my power!"
"Thunder... thunder... thunderstrike!"
"My hands unleash fury on Ao Shin's enemies!"
"I was chosen to exact justice."
"The strength of the storm dragon surges within me."
"I strike with a force of a thousand winds."
"The Life Dragon was deceived by evil. Never again!"
"My enemies will fall... to thunderous strikes!"
"A dragon's strength. A dragon's rage!"
"Threaten the dragon masters, and face punishment!"
"My fists are crackling lightning! My blows are crashing thunder!"
"Master Ao Shin's wrath rains down upon all villains!"
"None who do evil can stand against the storm."
"Corruption will never claim another dragon. This I swear."
"A slight against the dragon is a slight against justice!"
"None shall dishonor the dragons, not while I draw breath."
"My body is strong. The dragon is stronger!"
"My body flows like lightning."
"I am the dragon's will. That will prevails!"
"A dragon's rage is unrelenting, as are my fists."
"At rest, I am the gathering clouds. In motion, the hurricane is unleashed."
"From sacred grove, to hallowed mountain, no enemy can escape the cyclone!"
"The dragon saw the storm raging in me. His strength unlocked mine!"
"Because I did not turn away from my trials, Ao Shin will not turn away from me."
"No villain shall ever dishonor the dragons again! This I swear."
"My tempest sweeps away all who trample sacred ground and paint dragon's power."
"Tricksters, thieves, dragonslayers... my storm sweeps them all to ruin!"
"Chosen by the Dragon of Thunder, strong enough to weather any storm!"
"Ao Shin, grant me fists of crackling thunder! I wield them in your service."
"I scaled the mountain to prove myself worthy. At the top, I became the tempest."
"You were lucky to be blessed, Ashe, but I was worthy."
"You are not my patron, Aurelion Sol. I do not bow to you!"
"Ao Shin, is this another test? I will meet it."
"You have defiled a dragon, Brand! I will avenge your blasphemy!"
"A dragon's strength is wasted on a mere brawler, Sett."
"Shyvana, you resemble the masters, but possess none of their power."
Lee Sin does push-ups with his hands, then with his powers.
"You are but a tiny squall. I am the hurricane's wrath!"
"Can your dragon do this?"
"You're late, Ao Shin... seven years late."
"Couldn't hear you over this dragon."
Lee Sin summons a storm cloud that rains on him.
"With the power of... aw."
"Really? Did I offend you or something?"
"Are you blessed by a dragon? Because I'm blessed by a dragon."
Lee Sin laughs.
"Tong!"
"Tong!
"Ha!"
"Hueh!"
"Hikuh!"
"Hikuh!"
"Feel the tempest!"
"A shattering tempest!"
"Thunder and might!"
"You will learn discipline."
"Gale-force winds!"
"You can't withstand the hurricane!"
"I've trained for this!"
"Fists of lightning!"
"You know nothing of justice."
"I am the raging gale."
"Cloudburst!"
"Righteous thunder!"
"I am dragon-blessed!"
"Evil falls to the hurricane strength."
"A rain of blows!"
"With his power, and my fist!"
"Cyclone punch!"
"For the dragons!"
"My body is my weapon."
"Destruction rains down!"
"Lighting flare!"
"Crumble in the tempest wick!"
"Sacred power!"
"Thunderbolt strike!"
"The dragon's storm rages!"
"Pealing thunder!"
"Villians fall to my cyclone."
"I am worthy!"
"For Ao Shin!"
"Aurelion Sol!? Imposter!"
"We spar again, Ao Shin. I will triumph!"
"Your corruption ends now, Brand!"
"You're a disgrace to the dragon, Sett!"
"You're just an overgrown lizard!"
"You mock the true dragons!"

Lee Sin grunts
"Backforce!"
"Dragon blast!"
"Wrath!"
"Hikuh!"
"Hikuh!"
"Hmph, lacking in discipline."
"The gale of the dragon is all-powerful."
"This is the dragon's will."
"The dragon's storm destroys all villains."
"Unworthy!"
"You were no match for my draconic strength!"
"You stood no chance against the power of lightning!"
"Perhaps now that bow will find a stronger hand, Ashe."
"Challenge me again, Ao Shin. I will face you anytime."
"The Dragon of Life can rest once more."
"Your dragon's blessings were not enough, Sett!"
"I will sweep all villains to their doom! Master Ao Shin commands it!"
"Ao Shin lends me sight!"
"Look for the storm."
"Triumph requires vigilance."
"The dragon's protection."
"Always expect the storm of justice!"
"Dragon sight is superior!"
"The eye of the dragon does not blink."
"Calm before the storm."
"No villain can escape my vigilance!"
"For Master Ao Shin."
"Ao Shin, your power crackles within me!"
"Ride the lightning, fear the dragon!"
"My master's power is invincible!"
"I have... failed..."
"Master... forgive... me."
Lee Sin groans.
Lee Sin groans.
Lee Sin groans.
"I return stronger under Ao Shin's gaze!"
"The dragon's power shields me from destruction!"
"The storm builds, until it breaks."
