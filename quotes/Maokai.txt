"The Isles will bloom again!"
"Your reckoning will come either way."
"Beset by spirits, my home laid to waste... and they call  me  twisted."
"Life can come back, once the earth is turned."
"The water of life succumbed to death. The mortals will follow."
"Hold tight, my sapling."
"My heartwood is pure."
"Flee into the forest? I  am  the forest."
"I cannot find peace! Not even in the smallest branch!"
"Reckless mortals!"
"They trample life! I will trample them!"
"Drink deep of what magic remains."
"The idol is over."
"I do nature's bidding... to the very end."
"Oh... where did I put that sapling?"
"Living or dead, they are all the same."
"We must pull up our roots. Darkness corrupts the land."
"I will punish their wickedness."
"Life here existed in a time before death."
"What have you wrought, mortals? What have I?"
"Every step defiance!"
"A shadow has fallen, as men have fallen."
"There is beauty here, even now, in the human's fear."
"I will show them what was lost in the ruination."
"Human nature? Pah!"
"Fight for the saplings!"
"Nature's enemies gather."
"Stillness is not peace! It is death!"
"If I am already lost, I will take them with me."
"Once they were human. Now, they are only in my way."
"Mortals irritate me, like an itch beneath my bark."
"I cannot stop. The forest needs me."
"The Mist haunts my every move, yet I resist."
"I will end this misuse of magic!"
"I will fight for every pebble, every blade of grass."
"I once had peace. It is better to have purpose!"
"Once my limbs reached for the sky, now for nearest mortal neck!"
"I can watch the mortals doom themselves from here."
"The green in these plants, it is something I have lost."
"Once more into the grass."
"Nature conceals darkness."
"There is life still untouched by the Mist."
"The young sprouts beneath my feet, they tremble."
"The seeds of your destruction!"
"The sapling does not fall far from the treant!"
"If a human screams in the forest, will anyone hear it?"
"In the end, darkness destroys itself."
"I am nothing like you! I can't be!"
"For the forest to bloom, I will tolerate your presence."
"Come and meet your end - and a sapling or two."
"There is still life enough within me to grant you death."
"Your existence was not meant to be."
"To bleed the bloodless."
"Oh, what mortals will do for beauty. Kill, and wear pointy shoes."
"Stop putting web in my branches!"
"I hear your skittering, mortal."
"Trample that blade of grass, horseman. I dare you."
"One of many shadows on the Isles. The Shadow of War."
"It is the Isles that were betrayed!"
"Spirit of vengeance? And what of the forest?"
"The song of life, now silent."
"The saplings wish to hear your dirge. Please, sing it... while I destroy you!"
"You make me glad I don't have ears."
"Another pile of bones wearing a crown."
"Rival to the Ruined King - in ruin."
"It is torture enough being near you, spirit."
"A lantern? Ha! The forest is very dark indeed."
"The soul of the Isles is lost - beyond your grasp."
"So you're what passes for a hero among the fleshlings?"
"The Isles have forgotten more than just your name."
"Have you ever tried to dig through roots? Good luck, human."
"You would scour the Isles without planting a seed."
"An axe is no danger if I cut you down first!"
"Magic came from nature, and will return to nature."
"Yordle! Stay out of my trunk!"
"I'd like you more if you  were  a fox."
"You create only destruction, Star Forger."
"You make me glad I don't have ears."
"Strength starts in the roots - and you have none."
"You give sticks a bad name, and fiddles too!"
"Stop carving words into my bark! Everyone knows  G <3 K !"
"Demacia's walls will not stop the Black Mist."
"Kill them with  kindness? " Maokai laughs. "The sapling of the God Willow."
"Only men seek redemption."
"Make like a tree and vacate the area."
"A voice follows this one! A song, like those in the Mist!"
"The forest clings to life, and you would end it!"
"I am no abomination!"
"The forest clings to life, and you would end it!"
"I am no abomination!"
"Darkness gathers on the Isles - from every depth."
"Beware the mortals' gifts."
"You make me glad I don't have ears."
"A dangerous bloom, that one."
"The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns."
"It was a mistake to become human. You will share their doom."
"You forgot your roots!"
"Impressive words - but I'm a tree. I don't care."
"I fight to free you as well - though a hatchet would suffice."
"Silence, mortal. You only give voice to darkness."
"Are you going to Treemoot this year? I'm going to dress up as a sassafras!"
"No."
"The circle of life starts with death."
"If only the humans were vegetarians."
"I love all my saplings, especially how they taste."
"You defile the grove!"
"There is rot within!"
"Your life bloom fades!"
"Life feeds on death!"
"Where men fall, saplings rise!"
"It is good to ungnarl my limbs."
"Bones break before branches."
"The trees have learned violence."
"To find life, I will snuff yours out."
"It is in my nature."
"I refuse to wilt."
"Torment at your peril."
"Madness!"
"I will sow fear."
"This power is mine to command."
"Vengeance may be hollow, but so is my trunk!"
"How my branches groan!"
"Once this land knew solitude."
"Protect what is pure."
"I'll show you twisted!"
"So much life, stolen."
"Rooted out."
"Life torn from your grasp."
"The blessed waters turn within me."
"In the end, they all scream!"
"Stand back!"
"This will leave splinters!"
"Give them room to spread their leaves!"
"Seek the forest's foes."
"Away, my sapling."
"One with nature."
"Patient as a tree."
"Does this make you uncomfortable, Bramblefoot?"
"Greenfather, my sapling wishes to meet you."
"Careful, my sapling. Ivern is watching."
"The Greenfather spreads life. The Mist will end it."
"Lashing roots!"
"Fools!"
"Wretched souls!"
"Wood knocks back!"
"Another shadow."
"To rest, if only you could."
"I would end your burden, but it always returns."
"Enough bark, and there's no need for a bite."
"Blood makes the grass grow."
"Vengeance bears the sweetest fruit."
"Mortals? Hmph."
"You would fight the forest in the forest?"
"Mortals always invading."
"Begone, vile spirit!"
"The Isles will be cleansed."
"A friend of the forest no more."
"Pruning dead branches and odd ones."
"Mortal to the end."
"I wondered what happened to that tree."
"To strike a blow for nature."
"From a land where the trees are hardy and tall... and very, very cold."
"I do tend to punch things."
"Burn through the Mist."
"Is it woven from branches? I can never tell."
"To aid the waters within my wood."
"Restoring life."
"The grove beckons."
"Uprooted."
"Flee, my saplings... "
"The forest... "
"To the soil... "
"Another blade stuck in my bark."
"Didn't even notch my trunk."
"Hope blooms anew."
"The maelstrom has not ended!"
"I rage against this curse!"
"Do not defy nature!"
"GG!"
"So this is what they call getting stumped."
