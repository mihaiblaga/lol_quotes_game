"Hmm... let me fix that."
"Indeed, a wise choice."
"How befuddling!"
"The cosine of U-root, divided by... "
"Hmm... very interesting!"
"I could do that better."
"Order, entropy; a never-ending cycle."
"I concur!"
"Yes, yes, hurry, I have important work to get back to!"
"Hmm... let me fix that."
"Wonderfully efficient!"
"Goggles on!"
"By  my  calculations... "
"Did I leave the Tridyminiumobulator on?"
"Just as I hypothesized!"
"Aha!"
"How befuddling!"
"I put the scheme in schematic!"
"What an uncommon denominator!"
"Back to the drawing board!"
"Aha, 42, I knew it! Now - er, what was the question again?"
"42... there's just something about that number."
"I do love a good conundrum."
"Every problem solved is another revealed."
"One step closer to greater understanding!"
"Fascinating, isn't it?"
"Not enough variables... hmm... not nearly enough variables."
"Order, entropy; a never ending cycle. Or is it?"
"Brain over brawn!"
"I prefer a battle of wits, but you're unarmed!"
"Don't worry, you can learn so much from failure."
"Ah, Jayce. Mind if I borrow some of your 'hexpertise'?"
"Groundbreaking hextech innovation employed in the service... of punching."
"I don't agree with your methods, but by golly, do you get results!"
"If you seek to replace all humans, there will be no one left to appreciate your work."
"Have you considered making quieter hexplosives?"
"Your hexplosives are disturbing my research."
"Would you mind taking your hexplosives elsewhere?"
"Why do chemists call helium, curium, and barium 'the medical elements'? Because, if you can't 'helium' or 'curium', you 'barium'! Hm hm!"
"Why do people say 'you can't trust atoms'? Because they 'make up everything'! Hehe!"
"There are three key ingredients to invention: excessive imagination, good old fashioned stick-to-it-iveness, and a rocking good hairstyle!"
"Eureka!"
"Eureka!!"
"For great science!"
"I theorize... your defeat!"
"Back, you dirty ape, back!"
"You are poorly designed for this!"
"What a reaction!"
"Working as intended!"
"Exceeding turret output capacity!"
"Stop that! You will damage my turrets!"
"Raise your what?"
"This behaviour is highly inefficient!"
"Testing in progress!"
"This calls for a prototype!"
"I've applied the formula for success!"
"Mind your vectors!"
"I require my adjustable reverse-ratcheting magnetic box wrench!"
"Stand back! I am about to do... science!"
"They'll have a few screws loose by the end of this!"
"This will put a wrench in their plans!"
"Hmm, it's smaller than the diagram."
"Rise, my creation!"
"It's gone mad!"
"Ah, the sweet smell of science!"
"Perhaps I should try  more  rockets!"
"No, not  all  the rockets!"
"Come on... nngh...Â ?! WAAAAA--- "
"Alright, everyone! Remember your training and do your best out there!" (Pythagoras roars.) "Your first real battle! Are you ready, Pythagoras?" (Pythagoras squeals.) "Our first live-fire lesson will be conducted in the field." (Pythagoras squeaks.) "Now to apply the foundations of dragonography." (Pythagoras makes a disappointed noise.) "My apologies, dragonology!"
"Pythagoras, what are you doing up there?"
"Draconic enzymes. Highly flammable, and slobbery."
"The Aurelion Sol! Do you respond to treats? Chew toys? Can I boop your nose?"
"Braum! Surely you understand the need for compassion?"
"Your highness! Please, stay back! These dragons are my friends."
"Ah, a fellow dragon trainer! No, wait, you're just insane! Criminally insane!"
"Lulu! What excellent happenstance. Let's conduct a joint orientation."
"Oho! The fearsome Dragon Knight! You won't corrupt these dragons!" (Pythagoras roars.) "Pantheon, the First Dragonslayer! I suppose by now you are set in your ways."
"Fascinating! A half-dragon hybrid! I must add this to my field guide."
"What an adorable spirit guardian! But is it a dragon? I think not!"
"Swain! You are a pawn of the diabolical elder dragons. And we are going to stop you!"
"Tristana! Delightful. Everyone! We're having a sparring match!" (Pythagoras cheers.) "Watch out, Pythagoras! Vayne can't be reasoned with!" (Pythagoras makes a disappointed noise.) "Xin Zhao! You stopped the dragon sorceress. But did you have to destroy the eggs?"
"Aha! A Dragon Sorceress. If we defeat you here, dragon-kind shall be freed from your control!"
"Now class! Remember the rules! Shoot them with fire until they stop moving."
"You're interrupting our class! Keep it down, or you'll be forcefully ejected."
"You're right! That mastery isn't impressive at all."
"See that, Pythagoras? That's a mastery. They are irrelevant!"
"I don't want to sound rude, but these dragons can't understand a word you're saying." (Pythagoras protests.) "But they don't know that."
"I'm not calling you "Queen of the Monsters."" (Pythagoras groans.) "Grow another two heads and we'll talk."
"Your name is fine. "Queen Under the Mountain" is incredibly excessive."
"I don't think I can train them to tell better jokes."
"Get the treat. Go get it!"
"That way! Go that way!"
"Take this! And that!"
"Time to get serious, Lulu!"
"Your corruption ends now, Dragon Knight!"
"We'll stop you here, Swain."
"Tristana! Let our training commence!"
"Take this, dragon sorceress!"
"Are you smaller than before?"
"I'll be grading your performance."
"Play nice now."
"Sit, stay, and shoot fire!"
"Training in the field!"
"Who's a good dragon? You are."
"You're going to do great."
"Remember what we practiced."
"She's gone mad!"
"Here comes the big one!"
"Let them fight!"
"Yes! Shoot all the fire!"
"Woohoohoo!"
"Woohohoho!"
"Ah, the sweet smell of fire."
"It's raining eggs!"
"Sorry about that! My dragons are very excitable."
"Oho! You made them all crispy!"
"You shouldn't have worn such combustible clothing!"
"I didn't know you're allergic to dragon fire!"
"What a riveting turn of events! Huzzah!"
"Ah, the enchanting aroma of burnt... Oh my."
"Perhaps you'd like a lesson in dragon defense?"
"Excellent work, class! Today, everyone graduates!" (Pythagoras cheers.) "Those villains were no match for the class of 42!" (Pythagoras cheers.) "With this many adorable dragons, how could I lose?"
"Was the training to your liking? Lulu?... Oh. Oh dear."
"We came to train, and instead, defeated an ancient evil!" (Pythagoras squawks.) "You're free of the dragon's curse, Swain!" (Pythagoras coos.) "I'm so proud of us!" (Pythagoras squeaks.) "Aha! The first round goes to Pythagoras!" (Pythagoras cheers.) "We saved all of dragon-kind from Zyra! Excellent work, everyone!"
"Hah! My adorable friends. What are you... Oh, oh my, oh my! Ooh!"
"Oh! Hello there! Are you interested in... I say... This is highly irregular!?!"
"What? Are we going somewhere? Back to base? Ah... ah, ahh!!"
"Avenge... me..."
"Remember... our lessons."
"You know, we may require a new training regimen."
"Alright, everyone. Let's go back out there and try again!"
"What do you mean it was my fault?"
"Don't just sit there."
"Now you're the lesson."
"Now, Pythagoras!"
"An interesting hypothesis."
"Dragons are highly food-motivated. I know you're hungry. You're always hungry."
"Fire in that direction!"
"Dragons! Fascinating, aren't they?"
"This one is, hot!"
"Go!"
"Remember the three D's: desensitize, distract, dragon-fire."
"Aha! A new chew toy."
"According to my hypothesis..." (Pythagoras squeaks.) "Exactly!"
"Bite that one. That one! "Oh, forget the lessons."
"Shoot that way."
"Society has this whole dragon thing backward."
"Oho! So you think you can defeat a dragon trainer? En garde, whippersnapper."
"Here comes the heat!"
"All of this!"
"Attack!"
"Visualize the enemy."
"Be wary of dragon stress signals: devouring, incineration, burning villages, and etcetera."
"Be aware of predatory drift. If your dragon eats you, it's drifted too far."
"Make 'em extra crispy!"
"Resource guarding is a common and a natural behavior." (Pythagoras complains.) "You can sit on your gold pile when we get home."
"Ah! Of course! They are all good dragons."
"Stop chewing my hair!"
"Aim for the face!"
"Reptile or cuddle monster? I must know."
"Let's practice our aim."
"Just like I showed you."
"How many chew toys can one dragon destroy?"
"Hot! Hot! Hot!"
"Dragons are people too."
"What did you eat?!"
"Reptilian morphology, highly dangerous projectiles, and cute sounds when squeezed."
"Use operant analysis to train out unwanted conduct... Yuck! My hair is not a chamber pot!"
"Where did I put those treats? Aha! I'm holding them."
"Haha! In decoy-base training, you are the decoy."
"Here's a handy checklist for specimen conditioning: large stockpiles of meat, a suit of armor, a stronger suit of armor."
"Training is the pinnacle of modern dragonology."
"See something? Burn something! "How are you doing, Pythagoras?" (Pythagoras squeals.) "Excellent!"
"Diagnosis: indigestion!"
"So what if I need a haircut?"
"Zoosemiotics! Of course! How could I forget?"
"Pythagoras! Go!"
"Yes, yes, I know."
"Avoid swooping. Swooping is bad."
"I think she likes you."
"Don't singe my hair! Don't you singe it!"
"Watch out! Dragon burps!"
"Teaching dragons complex behavior. Hmm, yes." (Pythagoras screeches.) "Well, excuse you!"
"Does anyone understand how hard it is to fight a fireproof veterinarian?!"
"I know I left that chew toy somewhere."
"Hold still up there! I have a sensitive scalp." (Pythagoras groans.) "I believe in the future of dragon-kind!" (Pythagoras cheers.) "Try not to get toasted!"
"That's your target!"
"You're not a luck dragon! You're a Shuriman whelk." (Pythagoras squeaks.) "Eat this!"
"Of course I know where I'm going."
"Hmm. Subdivision into species. I see!"
"Dragonology is a truly fascinating field."
"Wet food or dry food? A perplexing conundrum."
"Sic 'em, girl!"
"Go to your spot! Good girl."
"Thoroughly socialize your dragon for maximum friendliness." (Pythagoras chirps.) "Yes, you are a good girl."
"Woohoo!"
"Fly, my pretty!"
"Introduce sporadic cuddling, subdue violent responses."
"Treats for all!"
"Too many variables"
"I would challenge you to a battle of wits, but I see you are unarmed!"
