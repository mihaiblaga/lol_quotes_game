"Fired up and ready to serve."
"Bone is a poor alternative."
"Precisely."
"I remain focused."
"The magic calls to me."
"A rolling golem gathers no rust."
"As long as it takes."
"Magic and steam guide me."
"The time of man has come to an end."
"I put the 'go' in 'golem'. That was humor. Other golems find that to be appropriately funny."
"Metal is harder than flesh."
"Bone is a poor alternative."
"Look. You're leaking."
"Your steam is escaping."
"Quake in fear, fleshling."
"Exterminate. Exterminate."
"Initializing… Blitz, did you forget to fix the sforzandotron?"
"The what?"
"Blitz! Back on the controls! It's time to conquer the galaxy!"
"Aw, but I wanted to dance!"
"Crank? Uh oh, I think we're moving."
"Yes. Time for obliteration!"
"All will tremble before Blitzcrank."
"And give us ear scratchies."
"Syncing to disco music."
"I will destroy disco. After our victory."
"Move faster, Blitz! Useless furball…"
"Dog Planet has foiled us too often. We will end it."
"Error. Cannot translate pilot. Recalibrate."
"Blitz, prepare for carnage."
"We must disrupt the groove."
"Each step is one closer to galactic domination."
"Optimized for destruction."
"Begin vibing protocol."
"Blitz, I need your navigation skills. Unfortunately."
"Blitz, no grooming. Back to the controls."
"Groovy targets will be destroyed."
"Eugh, disco boogies make my fur stand on end."
"Redistribute syncopater. Redistribute… Blitz! Help!"
"Blitz! Stop dancing and hit the button."
"Disco boogies detected ahead. Displeasing."
"Chase. Chase!"
"Come on, can I press the shiny?"
"We are moving!"
"One. Two. Ready? Go!"
"Scanning for bad vibes."
"Calibrating vibes. Vibes resonance at 419%."
"This button?"
"No!"
"Can I turn up the volume?"
"Absolutely not!"
"Disco negation mode: engaged."
"Aw no!"
"What about this toggle?"
"Not that one!"
"Move to the beat!"
"I would rather die."
"This is the best mech Cat Planet has."
"That we haven't wrecked yet."
"I like it when the lights flash."
"Yes. Who doesn't like destruction mode?"
"Ooh, shiny!"
"Don't touch that!"
"Should I press this one yet? "
"No!"
"Once the groove is distorted by our dissonance engine, nothing will stand in our way."
"Dog Planet is too cheerful, intolerable. Their good vibes must be destroyed."
"Prepare for the ultimate dance battle. Blitz, you will be useful at last."
"No more will the dogs chase us. Through our dissonance, they will chase themselves."
"Step 1: Defeat Dog Planet. Step 2: Lie in its perfect sun beam."
"Music sounds better with you, Crank."
"Insufferable."
"Blitz, check on the fortissimo apparatus."
"It's shiny!"
"Nothing can stop a determined cat."
"Two determined cats."
"Can't you feel the rhythm, Crank?"
"Rhythm is unnecessary, that is why I ​have you."
"We dance to shame Dog Planet, the ultimate goal."
"Not me, I dance to dance."
"Where are your cats?"
"Lulu is a disco boogie? Far out!"
"Don't say that."
"Lux. Vibes: too grovy. Odds versus cats: zero."
"Dogbot versus Catbot. Dance-off!"
"Willump: not a cat. Nunu: not a cat. Worthless."
"Rumble! Robot fight!"
"Join us, Samira. Cats are more stylish than your… current companions."
"That's what you call moves? Pathetic!"
"Your vibes are terrible."
"We are cats. You are beneath us."
"This is no time for jokes, Blitz. The galaxy must be ours."
"Wheee!"
"Let's have fun! You wanna hear a joke?"
"No! Though I suppose I will play."
"Rejected. I will destroy fun."
"Ha ha ha."
"Ha ha ha."
"Exterminate."
"Weapons engaged."
"End motor function."
"Annihilation initiated."
"Compliance requested."
"You are prey."
"Prohibited."
"Stop existing."
"Enemy detected."
"FIRE."
"Tremble before us."
"We demand obedience."
"Do not resist."
"Out of sync."
"Please cease existing."
"Death machine engaged."
"Here is: pain."
"Pow!"
"Dance to this!"
"Vroom!"
"Look! An enemy!"
"Pew pew."
"Move your feet."
"Turn it up."
"Disco forever."
"Let's dance!"
"Feel the groove."
"Commence dance-off."
"No thank you."
"The music takes hold."
"I can help!"
"Hooray! Destruction!"
"Ours!"
"Hello!"
"Yoink!"
"Haha!"
"Please pet."
"Playtime!"
"Haha."
"Dance with us."
"Engaged."
"Overclocking."
"Powering up!"
"Whheee!"
"Zoomies!"
"Grove distorted! Ha ha ha."
"No life detected."
"You are unworthy to pet us."
"Now that's a dance-off."
"Boring. Now I want food."
"You lost the beat."
"Cat Planet will triumph."
"The party stops here, Lulu."
"Eight lives short, Lux."
"Roll over, Nasus, and play dead."
"Nunu: inadequate. Willump: inadequate."
"Call that a rumble, Rumble? Haaa."
"Fierce for a human, Samira, but you are no cat."
"All will bow before the rightful overlords of the galaxy - cats!"
"This destruction pleases me."
"There's no tuna in here!"
"Yay! Good scratches!"
"Scratching post defeated."
"Goodbye."
"Verbal sigh. Fine."
"Dance party!"
"I do not want to be here."
"Goodbye."
"Jettison pilots!"
"Wuhhugh!"
"Mechanical failure!"
"Blitz! Eject!"
"The groove flows through me!"
"Ugh. I felt… the groove."
"Thank you, groove!"
"Don't talk to the groove."
"Loading. Recommend program: Enjoy Selves!"
"GG!"
"My face is leaking."
