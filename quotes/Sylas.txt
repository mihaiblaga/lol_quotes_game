"No more cages!"
"You can't cage me for long."
"So... who wants to kill the king?"
"The great mage rebellion starts now!"
"See the remnants of my bondage, and know you can be free!"
"Breaking out was nothing. Watch me break a kingdom!"
"Look at all those good, little cogs, unaware of the wheel they turn."
"Those who wait to be freed do not deserve freedom. Onwards, brothers and sisters!"
"This place has potential! Let's tear it all down!"
"A shepherd with no flock is just an idiot with a stick."
"No more kings! No more queens! No more mage-seekers! It all ends now!"
"They work their fingers to the bone serving a king they'll never meet! I must show them there is more to life!"
"How beautiful a world is without walls!"
"Only sheep need a leader."
"Conflict brings truth...eventually."
"Swine and sheep. That's all they are."
"Chains build revolutions, one link at a time."
"It took prison for me to find liberation."
"I will be the monster they think I am."
"Behold the true Order!"
"Rise up, brothers and sisters!"
"Time to crack the upper crust!"
"Time to take what's ours!"
"Tradition is a crutch for the mindless."
"Whatever they bring, I'll match it."
"Their shackles are now my weapons. Ha! How's that for irony?"
"Just sowing the seeds of rebellion."
"I used to be locked up, but I didn't care for it."
"What can they do to me, that they have not done?"
"From the rubble, true order will be born!"
"I will show them a world without lords or peasants!"
"I am no traitor. I am the true Demacia."
"I'm a man without a country. Perhaps I'll take this one."
"Once you've seen the truth, you can't keep living the lie."
"It will be brother against brother, father against son."
"A mage-seeker tried to test me once..."
"Question authority... then slit its throat!"
"The mage shall inherit the Earth."
"I was born a mage; Demacia made me a criminal."
"The bluer the blood, the sweeter it spills."
"We will rip the power from their cold, dead fists!"
"Every Demacian a king!"
"A man who seeks control is a man who needs to die!"
"Good, evil... what does any of that even mean?"
"Aah, how I missed the free air."
"No more slums, no more dungeons!"
"They locked up a boy, but let loose - a killer."
"Time for the kings to bow!"
"After fifteen years in the dark, I was illuminated."
"No prison can hold me!"
"At last, I've come for you! Jarro Lightfeather!"
"Well, well, Fiora! Aren't you the very portrait of privilege!"
"How much will the Laurent name be worth when your house is burned to the ground?"
"Oh, look! A walking monument to ignorance!"
"Idols are made to be desecrated, Galio."
"The wonderous Galio. Yes...I've read all about you."
"Ah, Garen! First to die for the ruling class."
"Hello, Crownguard! Remember me?"
"Villainy never knows itself...eh, Garen?"
"I'll give you a head-start, little princeling!"
"Jarvan! Where shall I hang your royal corpse?"
"Bad news, your Highness! It's time to end your bloodline."
*Laughs* "Do what thou wilt, Jinx!"
"Your secret is safe with me, Luxanna. Remember that kindness."
"Every light casts a shadow, Luxanna."
"I wonder, is that hammer meant for me?"
"Soar through the clouds, bird girl... but the earth quakes beneath you!"
"Ah...you're holding something magical. Aren't you, Rune Mage?"
"Discord is the best chord, Sona!"
"Do your walls keep other out, or you in?"
"You raise walls - I destroy them. Let's see who prevails!"
"I had to eat rats in prison. Suppose I could do it again."
"Do not mourn your parents, Vayne! They had it coming."
"I've done my time, Yasuo. Prepare to do yours!"
"Shadows are for cowards, Zed!"
"Noxian swine, Demacian swine. They'll all end up at the slaughter."
"You've been to prison. You know how this goes."
"The Vastaya have suffered much. But get in my way and you will suffer more!"
"You've traveled across the world to die for someone else's king? Pathetic!"
"Let me help you think for yourself."
"Return to your master, like the lapdog you are!"
"These things are killing me. Oh yeah, that's the spot."
"Ugh...that was worse than wizard prison."
"You think you're better than me?!"
"Embrace the chaos!"
"You'll have to kill me!"
"You picked the wrong side!"
"You're part of the problem!"
"Wake up!"
"They can't hang us all!"
"I'm not going back to the dungeons!"
"Topple the hierarchy!"
"Mages, unite!"
"Heads will roll!"
"Join me or die!"
"I serve  no one! "
"Catch me if you can!"
"Conformist swine!"
"MY streets!"
"
"
"
"
"
"
"Smash the throne!"
"Bring it all down!"
"I do not kneel!"
"Face what you've made!"
"Freedom before peace!"
"No more masters!"
"Revolution now!"
"The crown is a lie!"
"Do not allow them peace!"
"There is no king!"
"Free Demacia!"
"Unshackle your mind!"
"Look! A hostage!"
"This is the truth!"
"Long live the Rebellion!"
"Sweet liberation!"
"Magic is rising."
"A  true  symbol of our nation!"
"And that's how we slaughter swine."
"That's going to leave a power vacuum."
"For your own good, little light."
"I am sorry, little light!"
"Oh, the  irony. "
"A little taste of your own!"
"Hurts, doesn't it!"
"A fitting sentence!"
"Well, that was satisfying."
"Rightfully mine!"
"Magic cannot be caged!"
"Let's level the playing field!"
"What's yours is mine!"
"Call it redistribution of magic."
"Share and share alike."
"I'll give it back! Promise!"
"Let's see what you're made of!"
"Give it up!"
"Cheers!"
"I'll make good use of this."
"A powerful curse indeed!"
"I think I found your bear!"
"Time to watch it burn."
"A murder of crows, you know, for murder!"
"En garde, blue blood!"
"At last, the entrance I  deserve !"
"Surrender your sword, Crownguard."
"Might is wasted on the mighty!"
"I've got your justice!"
"We'll bring the cataclsym home!"
"A crown, a crown for everyone!"
*Laughs* "Sanctimonious!"
"Let's use that spark to light a fire!"
"Your spark is wasted, girl."
"Such magic should never be bound."
"Chains for everyone!"
"I'm just a convict with a hammer!"
"This rebellion just got wings."
"Now let's see what's on that scroll!"
"Fortississimo!"
"Let me speak for you, Sona."
"Well, this is going to be confusing."
"Ooh! I feel so toxic!"
"Time to jail the jailers."
"The winds blow in my favor."
"I'm no stranger to shadows."
"This will send them running."
"They always said I was a monster."
"Now it is I, who tries hard."
"Support for the cause!"
"I'm great at doing time!"
"That's all you've got?"
"Sure, why not?"
"Better than nothing."
*Chuckles* "I actually feel cheated."
"I guess I can work with this."
"Ugh," *Chuckles* "What do you  do  with this?"
"Sometimes... you gotta... pardon... yourself!"
*Grunts* "Let's blow this rat cage!"
*Grunts* "Always stay one step ahead of the law!"
*Grunts* "This is how we make a getaway."
*Grunts* "Our chains... are only as strong... as we think they are."
*Grunts* "The Revolution must pause... (softly) temporarily."
*Grunts* "That which restrains us begs to be broken."
*Grunts* "Attack, retreat. Consolidate, repeat."
"I am...martyred."
"Spread my words."
"Take me home..."
"At last... no walls."
"Not the first time I've had my neck in a noose."
*Chuckles* "I had worse beatings in prison."
"No time to lick wounds! Always hit the ground running!"
"As long as I draw breath, so does the revolution."
"Even death cannot chain me."
"I died many deaths in my cell. This is nothing."
"The meek shall inherit the earth."
