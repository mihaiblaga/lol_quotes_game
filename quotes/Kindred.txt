"Never one... "
"...without the other."
"You overstep."
"Never one... "
"...without the other."
"Never one... "
"...without the other."
"Every life... "
"...ends with 
us
."
"Tell me again, little Lamb, which things are mine to take?"
"All things, dear Wolf."
"Those who dread us grant us the most power."
"We are not dreams. We are the waking."
"The only true death is to never live.
"There are so many ways to die.
"Those who run from death... stood still in life.
"All will know us... in time.
"Beauty fades. That is why it is beautiful."
"Wolf chases what does not willingly go."
"Tomorrow is a hope, never a promise."
"Hurry, Lamb. Faster."
"I smell their fear."
"None can hide."
"Follow their tracks."
"Bits of them stick in my claws!"
"Fear makes the chase more fun!"
"All who run are mine!"
"Can't wait for them to flee!"
"I smell prey!"
"How does hunger feel?"
"Always there."
"I wonder how they see me."
"Ashes on wool."
"What sound do they make?"
"Feathers falling on fresh snow."
"None can hide!"
"Though many try."
"They race from us!"
"Only to find us sooner."
"The weft and weave of fate guides---"
"Words spoil the chase!"
"All things linger... "
"...in our shadow."
"They know we'll come."
"Yet they are never prepared."
"How long will we be together?"
"Forever more."
"Peacefully, they go."
"Hungry, we follow!"
"They laugh."
"And scream!"
"And dance."
"And flee!"
"And everywhere Lamb went... "
"...Wolf was sure to follow."
"And everywhere Lamb went... "
"...Wolf was sure to follow!"
Lamb hums.
Lamb hums.
Lamb hums.
Lamb hums.
Lamb hums.
Lamb hums.
"I see water!"
"They are called... tears."
"Chasing is the best game in the world... and I always win!"
"I'll give you a running start!"
"Not that it will help."
"It thinks it can beat us!"
"This is called... denial."
"Choose now - my arrows... "
"...or my teeth?!"
"We understand your loneliness, but... "
"...stay away!"
"Pop the balloon!"
"We know your name child. Woven across countless almost-lives."
"Rushing to meet us again, I see."
"Have we met before?"
"His song sounds good."
"The singer mistakes melody for substance."
"Long have we shadowed your deeds."
"Turn and face us now!"
"Trees make a boring chase!"
"Chase the cat!"
"Rengar is well-versed in the ways of the hunter."
"Now, he's prey!"
"Come, Sion, let us end this mockery."
"Sometimes, death is a blessing."
"There are no wolves like me!"
Lamb tries to shoot an apple placed on Wolf's head using her feet.
"Hold still, Wolf."
"Ahh! Don't shoot me!"
"What happens if you miss?"
"I don't know."
"Words, words, la la la, pew twang pew!"
"Are you imitating me?"
"I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm bored, chase chase chase!"
"You get it now!"
"The weft and weave of fate guides... um... uh... how did that poem go again?"
Lamb and Wolf laugh.
Lamb and Wolf laugh.
Lamb and Wolf laugh.
"Embracing life means accepting death."
"Panic not when life ebbs."
"All sparks kindle new flames."
"Depart in peace."
"Hush now. Rest."
"You shine brightly."
"Drift gently into oblivion."
"How one dies shows how one lived."
"Run if you can!"
"They struggle! Good!"
"They break too easy!"
"Feet tire fast!"
"Ready to chase? Too bad!"
"This will hurt - lots!"
"No more words!"
"Tear out the throat!"
"Rip them to bits!"
"My claws never dull!"
"This one is yours."
"Yes!"
"Lamb calls!"
"Wolf strikes."
"A careless step... "
"...then teeth!"
"Life is ours... "
"...to end!"
"Go easily."
"No! Thrash! Flee!"
"Time to... "
"...end this."
"Mine?"
"Ours."
"Flee - or stand firm."
"Doesn't matter!"
"Day always turns to... "
"...food!"
"The masks of the Kindred seek you!"
"Our mark looms over you."
"Treasure your final moments."
"Eternal twilight calls for you."
"Your next treat, dear Wolf."
"Fate hunts you today."
"A fine life reaches its conclusion."
"Their path is destined to cross ours."
"The hunt begins!"
"This one is ready!"
"Run! Now!"
"There you are!"
"I hope this one has strong legs!"
"I will chase it until it's dead!"
"We have your name."
"And your scent!"
"Your time has come."
"Ready or not!"
"We know your name!"
"We have always known it."
"When you see us... "
"...it's too late!"
"Shall we, dear Wolf?"
"Race you there!"
"This next one will be easy."
"And if not?"
"More fun."
"Its heart beats fast now!"
"It knows."
"Such befalls all who bear our mark."
"All your life has led to this moment."
"All life is temporary."
"Well hunted, dear Wolf."
"Return to nothing."
"That was a good chase!"
"Hahahahaha, that was fun!"
"Fun chase!"
"We take our mark!"
"Only to place it elsewhere."
"Our mark is lifted."
"Who's next?!"
"No match for me!"
"None are, dear Wolf."
"We win!"
"Always, dear Wolf."
"Who's next?"
"Everyone."
"All things, great and small... "
"...
die
."
"No match for us!"
"Few are, dear Wolf."
"The chase ends!"
"More lie ahead, dear Wolf."
"If it draws breath... "
"...it meets us."
"The weft and weave of fate guides---"
"The hunt is back on!"
"That was meant to be ours."
"We shall remember this theft."
"What folly it is to snatch our marks."
"You overstep."
"No! That was mine!"
"You stole my chase!"
"How fast can you run?"
"An emboldened thief."
"I will eat it!"
"You steal from us... "
"...we steal from you."
"Go, Wolf!"
"Run them down!"
"My turn!"
"Chase to your heart's content."
"Now, Wolf!"
"My turn!"
"Mine!"
"Now!"
"Now!"
"Shine once more, before the end."
"Savour life's closing act."
"Not here, not yet."
"Forged in a land unwelcome to us."
"For us, or them?"
"Sharp enough to slice the veil between life and death."
"A sharper blade makes for a cleaner death."
"They shall only hear 
my
 voice."
"Cut them deeper!"
"Strip away their armor."
"Rip it to shreds!"
"I thirst more!"
"It courses with stolen lives."
"They shall not ignore us so easily."
"Lamb, tell me a story."
"There was once a pale man with dark hair who was very lonely."
"Why was it lonely?"
"All things must meet this man, so they shunned him."
"Did he chase them all?"
"He took an axe and split himself in two right down the middle."
"So he would always have a friend?"
"So he would always have a friend."
"Are you there, dear Wolf?"
"I am, little Lamb."
"Are you sad?"
"I am."
"What does it feel like?"
"A long hunt with no kill."
"Is it time?"
"We will soon awaken from this pale slumber."
"Is this what it feels like to end?"
"I do not know, for this is not our end."
"Do others come back?"
"Those who do, wish they hadn't."
"How old are we, Lamb?"
"Older than those whose footsteps are long vanished."
"Many years."
"I remember them all."
"Have they forgotten us yet, little Lamb?"
"All still know us, though they try to forget. Soon we will remind them."
"What do all stories have in common, dear Wolf?"
"They end."
"And everywhere Lamb went... " - "...Wolf was sure to follow."
