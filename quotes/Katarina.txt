"Violence solves everything."
"Is that fear I smell?"
"Ready for trouble?"
"I've made my choice."
"Intriguing."
"Keep friends close and enemies guessing."
"Never play fair."
"To the point."
"Why? Because I can."
"No going back."
"I like it."
"Only fools hesitate."
"Better dead than dull."
"Come on, live a little... while you can!"
"If you run, you won't see me stab you!"
"My pleasure."
"Let the bloodshed begin!"
"Let's dance!"
"Blood for Noxus!"
"Without mercy."
"Is that fear I smell?"
"I can't wait."
"Only fools hesitate."
"Next time... run."
"Unmatched."
"The dance of blades."
"Too easy."
"They fear the power of my crest and the majesty of my blades."
"Let the coronation bloodbath begin!"
"I fight alongside my fellow queens. So long as they honor me."
"You face me? In the coronation? I will disgrace you."
"My crest feeds on blood."
"To disobey a queen's command is death."
"They fear my weapons? I am the weapon."
"They'll bleed for the crown. I can't wait."
"Kneel before me or bleed out."
"I bend any weapon to my majesty."
"I wield both crown and dagger with elegance."
"No one defies the queen."
"I am queen of Schema. Why stop there?"
"My rivals broke before me. The other queens will too."
"My rule is iron. My will is steel."
"After this, all of Elysia will know what I'm capable of."
"My crest is merely the first of many crowns."
"Murder isn't personal. It's fun!"
"Power is a weapon, and I do love a weapon."
"I killed for this crown. Fear what I'll do now!"
"Lives are short, unlike my legacy."
"My favorite part of ruling... is the executions."
"Weaker rulers show mercy."
"There's glory in bloodshed but there's also purpose. A feared queen reigns longest."
"I don't care if they're bowing or bleeding so long as I win."
"A victory is sweetest when it leads to another. After this, all will fear my power."
"For years, these queendoms have squabbled. Uneasy alliances, unstable power. I can use that."
"Ruling is one part grace, two parts threat. Or is it the other way around?"
"A queen's versatility and an assassin's ruthlessness. The coronation never planned on me."
"These other queens? I wish them luck. Why shouldn't I? There's no one like me."
"I always plan three steps ahead of other rulers but it's still gracious to feign surprise."
"The queens' alliance is feeble. To lead it requires strength. A bit of new blood."
"I am the queen of assassins. I won my throne by murder. I'd like to see these others try and take it."
"The tournament is only the first step. With me as queen, Schema will reign forever."
"Garen, let's see if you're strong enough to handle a queen."
"If you can see the future, Diana, you'll flee right now."
"Come all the way down from Aurai to play with us, Janna? Think you can keep up?"
"You've waited so long for this, Qiyana. Shame it'll be over so quickly."
"You'd be good in Schema's battle pits, Rell. As a warmup."
"Your majesty! This coronation, I'll whet my blade on you."
"Come back when you can wield a crest like I do."
"The magic of the world flows through my daggers. What have you got?"
"You wouldn't dare repeat that with my knife at your throat."
"The queen is not amused."
"The queen of carnage!"
"Bow to my blades!"
"Run not from a queen!"
"Blood for Schema!"
"You'll bleed so beautifully."
"Hail to the queen!"
"Glory to me!"
"A queen never hesitates."
"Justice by my blade."
"Your death will honor me!"
"I reign supreme!"
"A peerless queen!"
"Kneel to my throne."
"I command your execution."
"My victory is sealed!"
"For my crown!"
"Fear my glory!"
"My reign is unmatched."
"No one defies a queen!"
"Crest and blade!"
"Bow before you bleed!"
"I give no quarter!"
"Your death's decreed!"
"Off with your head!"
"I command you to die!"
"Your pain, my glory!"
"My queendom reigns triumphant!"
"The crown is mine!"
"Look sharp!"
"My royal decree!"
"My blade caught you off guard, Diana?!"
"Janna! Weak crest, weak queen!"
"Your plots are weak, Qiyana, and so are you!"
"Gonna use my crest against me, Rell?!"
"Bow before me!"
"You rogue!""
"Die, knave!"
"For my throne!"
"Die by decree!"
"A crown of daggers!"
"Your execution is at hand!"
"The queen's blades command you!"
"Bleed for Schema's glory!"
"Kneel before your queen!"
"The crown cannot be defied!"
"There's blood all over my dress now."
"A true queen can subdue any foe with grace."
"I'll take those curtsies now. Thank you!"
"Diplomacy is overrated. Stabbing's easier."
"Hmph. You were in my queendom's way."
"Pity you weren't better."
"Not today, Caitlyn! Not today!"
"What a shame, Garen. A queen requires a more worthy consort."
"Poor Diana. Your visions were as weak as your rule."
"Janna. Too flighty to be a strong ruler."
"Might have been tough as metal, Rell, but metal cracks."
"Not much of a coronation for you."
"My queendom reigns triumphant! Let the blood flow!"
"A queen's retreat is always strategic."
"We planned for this. The bloodshed will wait for me."
"This fight's beneath my station. I'll wait for a better one."
"Schema... must triumph..."
"This must not be... the end..."
"The coronation's not finished, and neither am I!"
"A great queen needs tenacity!"
"It doesn't matter who strikes the first blow. Just the last."
"A fresh addition to the royal arsenal."
"I do so love an accolade, especially a sharp one."
"Let's see what this one can do."
"Every triumph brings a new blade."
"The weapon is the setting. I am the jewel."
"Another? For me? I'm honored."
"Another blade! It's good to be the queen."
"A tithe of steel. I like it."
"Any weapon cuts just as deep... in my hands."
"Remember, 'evil' spelled backward is 'live'. No coincidence."
