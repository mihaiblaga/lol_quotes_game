"I'm on the case."
"Shall I turn in my badge and rifle as well?"
"So close to a breakthrough. All I must do is connect the dots."
"Every case, every investigation brings me one step closer to justice."
"It's easy to overlook the rust beneath the gilding, but I never miss a detail."
"My duty is to protect the citizens of Piltover, and I will see that through."
"I ought to thank  'C'  for setting me on this path. Life in prison seems a proper gift, does it not?"
"It should be progress, not power and fear, that leads Piltover into the future."
"I'm placing my trust in you lot. Let's see this case through... and try not to disappoint me."
"I'll be keeping a close eye on you, Jinx. You've caused enough chaos as it is."
"I'm glad you'll have my back, Vi. Let's keep the chaos to a minimum, shall we?"
"I will not tolerate lawlessness."
"Let's do this by the book."
"Always maintain a proper chain of command."
"The heart of Piltover is its people."
"I much prefer this to desk duty."
"Never a dull moment."
"It's my business to know what others do not."
"I'm not here to serve. I'm here to protect."
"Let's investigate."
"I must always be three steps ahead."
"I cannot afford to falter."
"The law bends for no one."
"No stone left unturned."
"Crime is common, logic is rare."
"Let's crack this case wide open."
"Hot on the trail."
"I'll have this finished before tea time."
"I love a good chase."
"Me, miss? Not by a long shot."
"I'm on the job."
"Even the smallest clue can break a case."
"A true professional is always aware of her surroundings."
"I do love a good mystery."
"Someone call for a sheriff?"
"Laws mean nothing when they fail to protect the public."
"One must never start an investigation without first examining the evidence."
"I always aim to win. And my aim is perfect."
"They cannot run from the long arm of the law... nor from the scope of my rifle."
"I am not Piltover's dog. I work for its people, no one else."
"No matter the situation, a good investigator always remains calm."
"I have all the evidence I need."
"This can only end with you behind bars."
"I'll take you and your confession back to HQ."
"Anything you say can and will be used against you."
"I know you're hiding something, Camille. I just need to prove it."
"Our values aren't so different, Ekko. Neither are Piltover and Zaun..."
"There is more to life than chasing glory, Ezreal."
"Am I to be the test subject for your latest invention, Heimerdinger?"
"Jayce, is this really the way to create a better tomorrow?"
"Is there a point to this madness, Jinx, or is it just a channel for your pain?"
"(gasps) Seraphine! Would it be inappropriate to ask you for an autograph?"
"This time, Urgot, I'll send you straight to prison myself."
"I never thought I would stand opposite you again, Vi..."
"Progress is essential to survival. But not like this, Viktor."
"Well, this is certainly interesting. Zac, was it?"
"Oh, a Yordle. How cute."
"Think you're above the law? Think again."
"Admitting your guilt? How generous."
"Ready, aim... (gasps) Urgh! Why am I not surprised?"
"You have the right to remain silent. I advise you use it."
"You won't escape!"
"Got them in my sights."
"I aim to win."
"This is where you yield!"
"Do not move!"
"No hesitation!"
"Let's rack this up."
"Suspect engaged."
"Surrender now!"
"Target in sight."
"I'll make this quick."
"Predictable."
"Stay out of my way!"
"No more cat-and-mouse."
"Up for a showdown?"
"In position."
"You cannot outrun your crimes!"
"Drop your weapons!"
"Brilliant!"
"As expected."
"Boom! Headshot."
"Pay no attention to the trap."
"Fancy a treat?"
"Mind the trap."
"Right where I want you."
"Got you!"
"Going somewhere?"
"Freeze!"
"Think again."
"Excellent shot!"
"Not so close."
"In my sights."
"Target marked."
"Taking aim."
"Calibrating..."
"Steady..."
"I never miss."
"Immaculate!"
"Exemplary!"
"So, it has come to this."
"I would've preferred you in cuffs."
"On to the next case."
"Open and shut."
"By the book."
"Tea time's over."
"Such a waste."
"An easy collar."
"Guilty as charged."
"Camille, I will not stop until I have all the answers."
"I cannot change the past, Ekko. But together, we can create a better future."
"Now, Ezreal, I'll take these artifacts as evidence."
"I hope you achieved the results you wanted, Heimerdinger."
"Our future will be bright, Jayce. I promise you."
"Perhaps Piltover can rest easy without you, Jinx. But Vi..."
"I was so looking forward to your next concert, Seraphine."
"A cell would've suited you much better, Urgot!"
"I never wanted this, Vi..."
"This 'glorious evolution'... it will not be our fate, Viktor."
"There are easier ways to create a kinder world, Zac."
"One down."
"And so it begins."
"Ready to surrender yet?"
"Perfect practice, precise results."
"Well that's going to take a great deal of paperwork."
"Case closed."
"Perimeter secured."
"Hardly what I'd call a defense."
"Securing the perimeter."
"Let's move up."
"Cheers."
"Thank you."
"Much appreciated."
"If crime never sleeps, then I'd best put on another pot of tea."
"Do not disturb the crime scene until I return."
"Be good while I'm gone, won't you?"
"I cannot let them down..."
"Can't leave this unsolved..."
"Tell Vi that I..."
"I'm back on the case! And this time I will not fail."
"It seems I may have a new suspect..."
"I'll be adding that to the charges."
"The hunt is on."
"I've fought this fight already. We win."
"Time to put the world right."
"Let's go save the future - and then fill out the appropriate paperwork."
"Alright, you primitives, listen up: this... is my boomstick."
"Oh, we're allies now? This timeline is all wrong."
"After this is all over, you're coming with me."
"He's here."
"The chrono fugitive is here."
"The future must be secured."
"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact."
"I've come too far to turn back."
"I know this road. I know exactly how it needs to end."
"The last revision is the only one that counts."
"Time is of the essence."
"Everybody runs."
"It's now or never."
"It's not the past that drives me, it's the future."
"Been here, done this."
"Any time, any place. I will find them."
"History is more durable than you think."
"The past isn't going to sort itself out."
"Time travel's not impossible, just highly improbable."
"Now when has that little time explorer gotten off to?"
"Everyone leaves tracks. His are all over the chrono field."
"I have to stop him before he does something tragic - like uninvent headshots."
"Of course time can be broken! Why do you think I have a gun?"
"Where I'm going, I don't need roads."
"The future's only hope is in the barrel of my gun."
"Let's crack on."
"When could he be?"
"This is my temporal plasma blaster. I point it at someone, they cease to exist."
"Keep moving on."
"Back to work."
"Tomorrow is now."
"Time has laws. Time  is  law."
"Reality is held together by laws."
"Time cannot be a circle. It has to be a line."
"I'm from the future."
"This place is purely... primitive."
"I don't want to talk about time travel. It always ends in diagrams."
"I take out trash - temporal trash. I'm a temporal garbage woman."
"Time is really more of a flat circle - with crosshairs."
"I can hit a target at three hundred meters - three hundred years in the past."
"Don't aim where they are, aim where they were."
"We can't just see the past, we have to observe."
"The future catches up with everyone."
"No one's altering the past on my watch."
"Set weapon power to 360. Disable scope."
"Who needs a warrant?"
"Too bad this model isn't powered by tears."
"In the future, one of us is alive. Hint: it's not you."
"This should be easy. My weapon is fueled by rubbish."
"Mine's bigger than yours."
"That's not a gun.  This  is a gun."
"You can say hello to the future when you're dead."
"Are you version six or seven? I've lost count."
"This timeline looks fabulous on you."
"Love me some Tryndamere."
"I don't have time for this."
"Aw, you hurt my time feelings."
"The witness described my target as being 'uniquely annoying'. Hm, could it be you?"
"It's easy to understand time recursion. The first step is you have to understand time recursion."
"If faulty, please return to the Ministry of Love."
"Is it under warranty if it breaks before it's even been built?"
"That's a temporal infraction for wasting my time."
"I'm the pun police - and you're under arrest."
"How primitive."
"Lovely."
"They can't arrest these sick moves."
"In the future, dancing is illegal."
"It's just a jump to the left."
"You only get one shot."
"This moment is all you get."
"You're wasting your time."
"You're an anomaly. I end anomalies."
"Like you never existed."
"I'm going to shoot you into non-being."
"What an antique."
"No one is guaranteed a future."
"The gun's mine, but here, have a few rounds."
"Time may stop, but I won't."
"You're out of time."
"Here's a taste of things to come."
"In the end, I will always catch you."
"Your time has passed."
"Your future ends with me."
"Ah, ah, ah... "
"Here's a prediction: you're going to die."
"This will be memorable - for me, at least."
"You can't fight time."
"There's no fighting the future."
"Everyone wants more time."
"Time dilation can be a real pain."
"So predictable."
"Arrest in progress."
"You cannot run and you cannot hide."
"Experience superior technology."
"This is the sound of inevitability."
"A closed loop is a situation contained."
"It's easy: pull the trigger, end their timeline."
"Thinking you have more time is the sweetest bait."
"Even time can't heal a headshot."
"No escape."
"Dodge this."
"The time is now."
"Laser precision."
"Time to run."
"I see you."
"For the future."
"Exhale and fire."
"Time to pull the trigger."
"Time's up."
"Boom, traumatic brain injury."
"Boom, nonexistence."
"Boom, cranium blast."
"Boom, brain hole."
"Peacemaker protocol initiated!"
"Time to take the shot!"
"Tempus fugit, scumbag!"
"Prepare yourself!"
"Countermeasures engaged!"
"Here's a warning - it's a trap."
"One singularity net, coming up!"
"Not so fast."
"Oh! That's got some kick!"
"In my sights."
"Taking necessary action."
"Time to take the shot."
"This time machine here can blow your head clean off."
"Chrono upgrade complete."
"You know what I like best? Bigger guns."
"The rememberancers say I win this one."
"Better luck next time, cupcake."
"Even a post-cog could see that coming."
"The future isn't something to play fast and loose with."
"You were unnecessary in the future."
"Nothing is future-proof."
"Your past finally caught up with you."
"Time breach repaired."
"That was the way it was supposed to end."
"I've been through harder training sims."
"In the future, we call that getting 'rekt'."
"Your era is no challenge."
"How elementary."
"The future's looking brighter."
"Time heals all wounds? Not quite."
"Well, that's all in order."
"Headshots are lethal in any era."
"Your future was defined by dying."
"Someone cares you died. Not me, but someone."
"That was extraordinary."
"You can't run from the future."
"The guilty always make mistakes."
"Time loop closed."
"I've closed the time-like curve."
"This is going to require a ton of paperwork."
"Happiness is a thermally active temporal blaster."
"Your future's not looking so bright."
"End of the timeline, punk."
"Want to know your future? You don't have one."
"Chrono criminal neutralised."
"There was no time left to hide in."
"That was easy."
"Paradox resolved."
"Urgh. That might break the continuum."
"I can't believe I used to dress like that."
"Oh. I hope you weren't my grandmother. Oh, she made delicious cupcakes... "
"The remembrancers will have a field day with this."
"Now who belongs in a museum?"
"You weren't the one I was looking for - but close enough."
"That was a long time coming."
"Cute toy, kid."
"Frozen in ice. Primitive, but effective time travel."
"Oh, that's fun in every timeline."
"I don't need the Blood Moon's permission."
"Ritual bloodletting. How primitive."
"Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything."
"At least you died with your boots on."
"D'you feel lucky, punk?"
"Back to the primordial ooze with you."
"Just a few more evolutionary cycles and you'll get it right."
"We should've stopped you sooner."
"Time to unplug."
"Oh. That may affect my timeline."
"We can't fix the past if we stay in the future."
"So 2016."
"Not even stars last forever."
"You can save the world next time."
"Mecha connection terminated."
"Time waits for no one."
"Nothing can stop me now."
"This truly is their darkest timeline."
"Everything crumbles with time."
"Could've sworn it fell to the left."
"Entropy is consistent in all timelines."
"Ooh, vintage."
"Classic."
"They don't make them like this any more."
"How positively retro."
"You can't buy happiness, but you can buy dessert."
"We can't just see the past. We have to observe."
"It's no pre-cog link, but it'll do."
"Temporal accelerators acquired."
"Well, I already have a big gun. Might as well."
"It gets easier every time."
"A primitive projectile weapon. Interesting."
"Not quite as tasty as a cupcake... "
"That would've been better with frosting and sprinkles."
"Bottoms up."
"That feels better."
"There's nothing a cupcake can't solve."
"That feels better."
"Chronology protection point set."
"Observation is everything."
"A little proactive preparation."
"Retroactive preparation confirmed."
"Awareness of the present is the key to having a future."
"They'd better have coffee in this timeline."
"Sometimes you to go back to move forward."
"No signs of intelligent life."
"Deja vu all over again."
"Look out, boys, there's a new sheriff in town."
"Chrono recall engaged."
"Where I'm going, I don't need hats."
"I'm definitely going to need a bigger gun."
"Sometimes forever is just one second."
"Sometimes forever is just one second."
"Where I'm going, I don't need hats."
"No signs of intelligent life."
"Deja vu all over again."
"Chrono recall engaged."
"Sometimes you to go back to move forward."
"I'm definitely going to need a bigger gun."
"Recon complete."
"Where I'm going, I don't need hats."
"Chrono recall engaged."
"Sometimes you to go back to move forward."
"They'd better have coffee in this timeline."
"No signs of intelligent life."
"This timeline is sugarcoated."
"Recon complete."
"Look out, boys, there's a new sheriff in town."
"I'm definitely going to need a bigger gun."
"They'd better have coffee in this timeline."
"Recon complete."
"No signs of intelligent life."
"Sometimes you to go back to move forward."
"Where I'm going, I don't need hats."
"Sometimes forever is just one second."
"Deja vu all over again."
"Chrono recall engaged."
"I might have time for some big game hunting."
"Recon complete."
"Where I'm going, I don't need hats."
"They'd better have coffee in this timeline."
"Look out, boys, there's a new sheriff in town."
"Sometimes forever is just one second."
"No signs of intelligent life."
"Chrono recall engaged."
"I'm definitely going to need a bigger gun."
"Sometimes you to go back to move forward."
"Temporal field stabilized."
"Temporal sync reset."
"Chrono stasis field disengaged."
"Pulsefire jump complete."
"Time warp field regenerating."
"With my strategy we can't lose. Just pay attention and follow my lead."
"I've prepared dossiers on our opponents. Study up."
"Everyone sees Labrys academy kids as problem students... until we win."
"These pawns need a queen."
"I won't let them see me sweat."
"I am the best Labrys has chosen."
"The world is watching. Stay focused."
"Classmates aren't friends. They're pawns."
"It's orderly at the top."
"Everyone expects great things from me."
"Losing isn't an option."
"I chose Labrys as much as it chose me."
"Labrys, watch my flank."
"If I don't give my all, the others never will."
"With Labrys's power I won't lose."
"Effort means nothing without results."
"Labrys may be strong, but it needs me."
"Labrys's eye is always watching."
"Step lively, now."
"I'm here to win. That's it."
"I love knowing my plan's in motion."
"Haven't met my equal. Never will."
"My strategies succeed every time."
"Leaders earn loyalty with a carrot and a stick. Mine are study guides and fist fights."
"I rose tot he top my first year. What's left for year two?"
"My classmates have potential but lack focus. I'm their only hope."
"It's not my problem that I ruin the grading curve. It's everyone else's."
"I learned more from my fights than I did from my classes."
"Every great general came through Labrys. That's why I enrolled."
"I don't just defeat my opponents. I teach them never to challenge me again."
"In the classroom and on the battlefield my strength is absolute."
"Labrys is the most ruthless of the god-weapons. Fitting."
"I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to make a name for myself."
"Such adorable optimism, Ezreal. I'm going to crush it."
"Garen, I thought you were smarter than this, but... I guess not."
"Only room for one class president at the top, Jayce."
"Labrys wasn't good enough Katarina? Or you weren't?"
"Leona? Fine. Show me what you've learned."
"Garen's never mentioned you. I wonder why."
"Those who can't do, teach. Right, headmaster?"
"Looking to spar, Wukong? Sure, I've got two minutes."
"I hear your brother might be joining us at Labrys. Is that right?"
"They say you train heroes, Yuumi, but are they winners?"
"Do those outfits give you power or are you just lazy?"
"Too much hugging not enough fighting. Never got the appeal."
"Hah! Cute outfit."
"Is that supposed to intimidate me?"
"My flan is unbeatable. You have to whisk it instead."
"This is my flan, my recipe for success."
"Spare me the banter."
"A-plus accuracy."
"Awful form."
"Not worth my time."
"I'm a genius."
"Drop out."
"I should've won by now."
"I've studied for this."
"Pay attention."
"Why won't you lose?"
"Flunky."
"Watch closely."
"I'm just better."
"Class is in session."
"You can't win."
"I came prepared."
"My turn."
"Don't bother trying."
"I won't lose."
"Easy A."
"You will fail."
"You deserve to lose."
"New plan."
"Let's do this, Labrys."
"I'll always win."
"Perfect!"
"All according to plan."
"I knew that's where you'd go."
"You activated my snap trap!"
"Somebody's not paying attention."
"Let's end this!"
"Ace in the hole!"
"My plan is unbeatable!"
"Marks for effort."
"Another test aced."
"Study harder next time."
"There's a reason I'm top of my class."
"Not a hair out of place."
"Good, but not perfect."
"You miscalculated."
"Senpai noticed."
"Didn't make the grade."
"You've failed."
"How can you still be smiling Ezreal? Stop that!"
"Hit the books before you try to take me on again, Garen."
"Why, Jayce this might call for impeachment."
"You could have been great, Katarina. Such a shame."
"I expect better from you next time, Leona."
"Now I understand, Lux. You're the family embarrassment."
"And those who can't teach... are headmaster Swain."
"Work on your restraint, Wukong, or you'll never beat me."
"Yone. So quick to anger, so easy to defeat."
"Looks like we'll have to mark you absent, madam principal."
"I've been five steps ahead this entire battle!"
"Time to restrategize."
"You think that was my only plan?"
"Jumping ahead to plan Q."
"Let's take a look at the options."
"I'm not worried. I've prepared for this."
"How could I lose?"
"I got sloppy. Won't happen again."
"I can do better. I have to."
"I can't afford another mistake."
"Failing's not an option for me."
"This time I must be perfect."
"What's happening?"
"This is better than I could have dreamed! Time for a new plan."
"My weapon transforms!"
"I made this happen? My own power is growing too!"
"I feel I've changed as well. We'll perfect our skills together!"
"Labrys' power level."
"Even more power?"
"Only I can unlock Labrys's true potential. I am destined for greatness!"
"With Labrys's final form I am unbeatable!"
"Labrys grows stronger!"
"Labrys has made me unstoppable! Nothing will stand in my way."
"Another transformation!"
"The Sheriff's in town."
"I've got a    cupcake  for you, little Yordle."
"Sharp shooting, everyone."
"GG!"
"Alright you Primitive Screwheads, listen up! You see this? This... is my Boomstick!"
"That's not a gun.  This  is a gun."
"Time loop closed."
