"Death by my hand."
"With overwhelming force."
"Exploit every weakness."
"Scurry, weakling."
"Witness true strength."
"Unmatched power!"
"Autographs after the game."
"I don't need a buzzer to tell me when to start dominating."
"The dunk prophecies are true. Darius has arrived."
"Every lane is my lane."
"Darius knows dunk."
"Dunkin' ain't easy."
"I execute… on goals."
"What's 'passing'?"
"It's all muscle memory."
"Always dunk for the throat."
"I don't give 100%, I take it."
"What the ref doesn't see is legal."
"It's game time."
"I don't practice."
"Don't break rules, dunk them."
"Whose house? My house."
"Any game I play is a home game."
"When you're finished training, train more."
"I don't play the game, I am the game."
"I don't see a team, I see coattail passengers."
"There's no I in team, but there is one in Darius."
"Somebody had to be me, might as well be me."
"Better call traveling because I'm going places."
"Is this seriously what I'm up against?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise this was a charity game."
"Amateur hour."
"You might wanna go get a day job."
"Be straight with me, who let you in here?"
"Here's a good candidate for the Hall of Shame."
"Why'd you show up without my towel?"
"This is the dunk train, running you down."
"Was your plan: all pain, no gain?"
"No-one wants to play with you, Amumu."
"Hey, mummy! I'll give you something to cry about!"
"Oh look, Amumu. Your coach run out of last picks?"
"Dat fail."
"Judging by your face, Brand, I'd say we've met before."
"What do cops and donuts have in common? I dunk them!"
"Diana. Pale, white and cratered."
"Hey, Draven! Momma said you were adopted!"
"You'll go where I tell you, Mundo."
"Hey, Mundo! I hope you please to go to the fountain."
"Nice glove, Ezreal, maybe you can use it to pick yourself up after the game."
"Fiddlesticks. Spooky."
"Arrr, you suck."
"Nice spin, Garen, that'll help while I run circles around you."
"What's your secret ingredient, Gragas? Failure?"
"Bring an umbrella, it's raining dunks!"
"Hey, Lee Sin! Feast your eyes on--- oh, my bad."
"Oh no, it's Leona. I'm gonna get a tan."
"Uh oh, here comes Lulu and the butterfly."
"Sorry, Malphite, I've got the rock now!"
"Hey, Maokai, I know a court you might've been related to!"
"Maokai, you'd be better as the bench."
"What is it you mastered, Yi? Sucking?"
"Nocturne. Spooky."
"I don't get nightmares, Nocturne, but you  are  putting me to sleep."
"Thanks, Orianna, you brought a ball for me to dunk on you with!"
"Ball up again, Rammus. Makes it easier to dunk you."
"Look alive, Sion! Oh, right."
"Hi, Sona! That was the sound of you failing!"
"Sona, I hear you can't talk. I know you can't play."
"You called for a star, Soraka?"
"You look as good as you play, Trundle."
"Udyr: four stances, no style."
"Those are some pretty big hands to drop the ball with, Vi."
"The only blood on the court will be yours, Vlad."
"Rewind that, Zilean, I wanna see it again."
"Go home, shrub."
"Got my PhD in Dunk, and class is in session."
"I'm in the business of dunking, and business is good."
"From the fountain, off your face, nothing but dunk."
"You even trying?"
"You know who I am."
"I burn the playbook."
"You all play. I win!"
"I'm here to dunk."
"You the mascot?"
"Talent wins games. Period."
"I make it happen."
"Hey, it's a physical game."
"Win or go home."
"It looks easy, but I'm just that good."
"It's okay to be afraid… if you're bad."
"My stats speak for themselves."
"What you didn't see? Quickness."
"Eye on the ball… or your face."
"Don't hate the player, hate yourself."
"The key to victory is giving me the ball."
"I'm the full package. Playmaker, spine breaker."
"Whose court is this? Damn right it's mine!"
"Dunk is the gift I give to you."
"Like my kicks? Take a closer look!"
"You want a piece of the D-man?"
"I'm here to dunk."
"It's game time."
"Back off!"
"Watch it!"
"Get fouled!"
"Street rules!"
"Want some?"
"Bring it!"
"Come here!"
"Take notes!"
"Dunkmate!"
"My house!"
"Get dunked!"
"Too easy!"
"Sit down!"
"Boom!"
"Da dunk!"
"There it is!"
"See ya!"
"Yeah!"
"Rookie!"
"Dropped!"
"Knock knock!"
"Eat it!"
"Faced!"
"All day!"
"Thanks for playing!"
"Shoes are worth more after I wear them."
"They should pay me to wear these."
"Noxus Air: the only brand I wear."
"It isn't the shoes, it's me."
"If you like my shoes, you can always find them stomping all over the competition!"
"It's not gear until someone bleeds on it."
"You gotta' want it, you gotta' bleed for it."
"I'm gonna rename this⁠—Dunkthirster!"
"Let me teach you about persistence."
"Stay on the man."
"Infinity Dunk on the way."
"For a dunk legend like me, only Infinity Edge will do. Infinity Edge: the closest shave."
"Yeah! Come guard me now!"
"Put your Mortius where your mouth is!"
"Let 'em think you're done, then put it down!"
"I'm the only magic allowed on the court."
"Knowing you're up against Darius is all the omen you need."
"Everyone around me is moving in slow motion."
"You can try to foul me. Really⁠— try ."
"When I'm hungry, I turn to Ravenous Hydra. Pure energy, no carbs."
"Triple team me! Save me some time!"
"You can all share… in the dunkstruction!"
"That's right, I'm on what?"
"Put more people on me. I like it."
"You think I was hot before?"
"The Trinity is where dunk meets dunk… meets… dunk."
"Three reasons I'm the best⁠—D, U, and Unk."
"Three way dunk? I got this."
"You gotta see the whole court."
"Keep your head on a swivel."
"There. Don't say I'm not a team player."
"Quick substitution."
"The game will resume when I return."
"I'll be back, delay the game."
"Stay hydrated."
"Put me back in."
"So this is what the bench looks like."
"The tyrant-king has come to die, let's give him what he wants!"
"Do what you want with the rest, leave Garen to me!"
"Tear the king from his throne! Grind his bones to dust!"
"We are all wolves."
"All life will be reforged in violence."
"This war is just beginning."
"Demacia will drown in blood."
"Peace favors the weak."
"I won't submit to the mandates of tyrants!"
"True heroes feast upon the bones of kings!"
"War is coming, beautiful, unending war."
"The wolves are at your door."
"Endless conflict lies beyond the throne."
"Freedom, anarchy, call it what you will."
"My pack demands royal blood."
"Be free to fight, be free to kill."
"Witness the end of an empire!"
"I will save the world from its weakness."
"Find freedom in the carnage."
"I have tolerated gods and kings long enough!"
"The world will embrace chaos!"
"What I hunger for, is war!"
"Death to the king, by my hand!"
"Laws make people timid, frail."
"I'm not a savior, I am an executioner!"
"The strong will rise!"
"Every king dies, some faster than others."
"I reject the delusion of control."
"Slaughter the lions in their den!"
"We must escape this prison of peace."
"My howl heralds war and death."
"Seize the beast within, and become it!"
"War separates men from kings, predators from prey."
"This power was meant to destroy. Gods, men, everything."
"A wolf knows the scent of fear, royals are covered in it."
"If they won't give up their power, I'll tear it out of them!"
"The throne doesn't interest me, putting an axe in it does."
"A thousand more years of stagnation, or one dead God-King."
"Kill a king, change the world, kill the God-King, change everything."
"I'll silence kings and butcher the gods, chaos will swallow the earth."
"Rulers are complacent, soft, and the wolves are always hungry."
"I was born to end tyrants, and bathe their kingdoms in fire."
"Demacia is a disease,  I  am the cure!"
"I'll purge the old order so it cannot stifle the crucible of violence."
"These petty tyrants are weak, I am not."
"Crush this feeble excuse for a Crownguard."
"Our foes are weak, finish them quickly!"
"An age of conflict is within our grasp, all we have to do is take it!"
"This battle belongs to the wolves!"
"Time to put these little lambs out to pasture!"
"Struggle! Bleed! Do not give in to weakness!"
"We can't lose here, the wolves must feed!"
"We are being overwhelmed, but stay calm, take every advantage!"
"Would you bend to the might of kings? Then fight!"
"Don't give in! Together, we can topple giants!"
"Worthy adversaries are the stones that sharpen our claws!"
"They can't stop this war no matter how hard they fight!"
"Gods, kings, I don't care what they are, we end this today!"
"Our enemies struggle so valiantly, and for what?"
"There's a place for you in the war to come. Until then, step aside."
"The age of gods has ended… that means you."
"You fight to end the tyranny of gods, but they are all dead, and now you face me."
"I also hunger, creature. And when I hunger, I kill."
"No one will be spared from the carnage, brother. Not even you."
"So they sent the magic statue, Demacia must be desperate."
"What a mewling little kitten."
"You're afraid this war can't be stopped, Garen… and you're right."
"The wolves are coming for us all, Garen. Can you hear them?"
"My wolves will tear the angels from the sky."
"I'll kill you first, then those things you call masters."
"Another servant of the throne, and a pigeon." *Laughs*
"I think that demon inside you needs some fresh air."
"When I hold your skull in my hands, it will whisper of your failure."
"Let me honor your death wish."
"I can smell the fear on you." *Laughs "Night is falling on the old world, you won't live to see the new one!"
"I don't discriminate, some of my best friends are demons."
"Don't start making godly decrees, and we won't have a problem."
"Sorry I haven't been in touch, I've been overthrowing despots with god powers, like an adult."
"You've become weak, Garen. Where is your old hunger?"
"I'm disappointed, Garen. You could've been so much more."
"Your people won't miss you, Garen. No one will."
"I don't listen to the bleating of sheep."
"What are wolves to a lion?"
"Heh, the futile mouthings of a coward."
"What do you call a god who kills other gods? You call him Darius… then he kills you."
"What is war good for? Lots of things: a world for the strong, endless violence, nation wide morale, manufacturing b-, well that's three things right there!"
"Hey wolf, tell me a story. That's a good story."
"I kill three things: gods, kings and idiots, and you're starting to sound like an idiot."
"Your cowardice betrays you!"
"Stand, and die!"
"Cry havoc!"
"With overwhelming violence!"
"You chose the wrong side!"
"Embrace the flames of war!"
"I offer you freedom, in death!"
"Scurry, bootlicker!"
"You will lie broken in my wake!"
"My strength will prevail!"
"You could've walked away!"
"Your neck is exposed!"
"There will be no peace!"
"I'll carve a path to the throne!"
"I smell your fear!"
"The old guard will be purged!"
"Violent revolution!"
"Exploit their weakness!"
"Renounce your loyalty!"
"I will not tolerate weakness!"
"A lamb to the slaughter!"
"This land will be your grave!"
"I'll cut that head from your neck!"
"Do not deny me!"
"Your tyranny ends in death!"
"Face me, tyrant-king!"
"The cycle will be broken!"
"I challenge you, ancestor!"
"Anarchy!"
"You are my prey!"
"All despots will fall!"
"Dog of the empire!"
"This is rebellion!"
"You made your choice!"
"You can't run."
"Bleed for your king!"
"I have your scent!"
"
"
"Bite at their heels!"
"I smell blood!"
"You're wounded."
"Run, coward!"
"Blood for blood!"
"Did you think someone would save you?"
"You've got some red on you."
"Where are your gods now?"
"Food for the wolves."
"You can't hide from me!"
"Face me."
"Coward!"
"No escape!"
"This ends now!"
"Where will you run?"
"You die here."
"Where are you going?"
"On to the next."
"Couldn't survive the chaos!"
"Anniliated!"
"I win, you lose!"
"Where will I put all these heads?!"
"More necks for my axe!"
"A throne of corpses!"
"Liberated."
"Do you regret opposing me now?"
"Another carcass for the wolves."
"Safety is an illusion."
"Don't turn your back on a wolf."
"One more for the chopping block."
"Look what loyalty got you."
"First you, then whoever holds your leash."
"Can't start a revolution without severing a few spines."
"Buried, with the other weaklings."
"Torn to pieces."
"I like the way you die."
"Everyone has a choice, and you chose to die."
"The weak will feed the strong!"
"Demacia dies with you."
"Long live the king."
"Lion, tyrant, corpse."
"Every time you return, I'll just kill you again."
"I am the tide that topples kingdoms!"
"War has come for all of you!"
"Another symbol of an impotent throne."
"Nothing they build can keep me out!"
"Leave no walls for them to hide behind!"
"Bring it all down!"
"Now they know we're coming!"
"May the strong devour the weak!"
"A feast for the wolves."
"Our enemies should fear us."
"Fit for a king!" Laughs*
"Savage!"
"You've gone soft."
"What was that?"
"That tickled."
"I may be gone, but the wolves are always circling."
"So brittle, so worthless."
"Always more rulers to put down, always more thrones to break."
"There better still be kings to kill when I come back."
*Laughs* "Pathetic!"
"It's already… begun…" *Laughs*
"I… am war…"
"The king… must fall…"
"Ha! Looks like it didn't take."
"To live or die. To rule or be ruled."
"I will overthrow death itself if I have to."
"This rebellion isn't over yet."
"Not even death can contain me."
"You can't kill me in a way that matters."
"Strength will prevail!"
"You have proven your strength."
"GG!"
