"As I live, all will die!"
"Chaos will follow."
"All will suffer as I have!"
"Make this hurt..."
"Shred their fragile bodies!"
"They will feel pain they've never imagined!"
"Massacre them!"
"Trapped in a box so long Xerath, they never should have let us out!"
"Xerath, we will give them what they deserve..."
"There is no retreat."
"Welcome the havoc."
"Destruction approaches."
"Lavish brutality."
"Chaos will follow."
"Who's next on the chopping block?"
"Nothing will stop me!"
"Nasus cannot escape me forever!"
"The slaughter will never end!"
"Come back when you've collected all the bits of yourself!"
"You should have done a better job locking me away, Nasus!"
"You are not my brother, traitor!"
"What? Do I have someone in my teeth?"
Renekton laughs.
Renekton laughs.
Renekton laughs.
Renekton laughs.
Renekton growls.
Renekton growls.
Renekton growls.
Renekton growls.
Renekton grunts.

Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
"I will spare no one!"
"I will gut you all!"
"I will tear the world asunder!"
"Now you will know agony!"
Renekton roars.
Renekton roars.
Renekton roars.
Renekton roars.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
"Cut them down!"
"Embrace the jaws of death."
"I'll leave them in pieces!"
"Carnage."
"Bask in their blood!"
"Light meat, dark meat, it's all the same."
Renekton laughs frantically.
Renekton roars.
"No suffering is too great!"
"Oceans of blood!"
A crowd cheers.
Renekton roars and growls.
"What I've seen. What I could have been! All gone."
"I'm PROJECT's experiment. And it's nightmare."
"And what do the PROJECT overlords have in store for me today?"
"The virus cannot devour what I have already crushed."
"No humanity to lose, not anymore."
"Caution protocol, offline!"
"This city falls when I say so."
"Meat, metal, that's all there is."
"Dare to face transcended humanity!"
"When I light up, they better run."
"Just following orders, but I do enjoy them."
"Guns and augments lead to...accidents."
"The carnage is just beginning!"
"Once I've destroyed Program, I'll come for PROJECT."
"Inilitize charnel protocol."
"They think my rage is useful, for now."
"PROJECT's first line of defense, a deadly offense!"
"So close to transcendence."
"No one controls me...I don't control me."
"Always optimized! Rarely in compliance."
"Next-gen slaughter tech!"
"Weapons grade fury!"
"PROJECT makes me. I make the mess."
"This world is obsolete."
"My own brother wouldn't recognize me in this suit."
"Hardwired for wetwork."
"Blood on my chassis!"
"Corrosion gnaws at everything."
"My suit responds to me, and me alone!"
"I like it when they die quick."
"No future in this city! Or outside it."
"Modified for bloodshed!"
"I can't leave this world, but I can tear it to shreds."
"I'm PROJECT's background daemon. Terminating rogue processes."
"When they upgraded me, I lost everything...Except my rage."
"Augmented beyond human ability! And human pity."
"I glimpsed a better future. Glorious! Transcendent! But not for me."
"I volunteered, thought I'd become a god...Stupid."
"My arm, my suit, my blade! What's the difference? All built for butchery."
"I went instead, so 
 
Nasus
 wouldn't become...this. Should have let him go."
"When corporate needs someone liquidated, they send me!"
"Not much left of who I was."
Not much left of anyone I faced either."
"The Program's even more dangerous than me! I take that personally."
"We're temporary allies, Ashe, I'll kill you the second I can."
"PROJECT's come a long way since you, Master Yi."
"Thought PROJECT beat you already Mordekaiser, but I guess it didn't send me."
"Am I talking to you, Pyke? Or are you just another backup."
"G/NETIC rebels? PROJECT is the only future, Sejuani."
"Made it out of cyberspace, Senna? I'll send you back."
"Planned obsolescence, Sylas? My plan, your obsolescence"
"Varus, there's three of you, and you're still no match for me."
"I'm what you could have been, Warwick. What a waste."
"Corrupted code detected."
"You think I'm on your side? I'm on no one's side!"
"I'm the future of humanity! Try to keep up."
Renekton scoffs. "Mute your mic."
Renekton rides his cleaver like a skateboard.
"How many assassins does it take to slaughter a boardroom? Just me."
"That's a joke? You're the joke!"
Renekton Laughs.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
"Blade engaged!"
"Leathality amplified!"
"Offline."
"Erased!"
"Your codes broken."
"Retiring vital systems!"
"Rendering!"
"Inferioir!"
"Defragmenting!"
"Streamlining."
"Decommision queued!"
"Reflexes overclocked!"
"Pah. Pathetic."
"Terminate."
"PROJECT's orders."
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.
Renekton grunts.

"Rebooting subroutines. Upgrade initiated."
"I was floating through infinity, and now I'm back here!"
"New modifications available."
"Free for a moment..."
Renekton yells.
Renekton grunts.
"For a moment, but no...back to the metal cage."
"I was floating through infinity, and now I'm back here!"
"Out of cyberspace, into the suit, again."

"GG!"
"One day, you will suffer!"
