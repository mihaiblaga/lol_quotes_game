"Fine, we go."
"Back to the forge."
"A day away from my forge is a day wasted."
"All I need is myself, and... hammer."
"The best meal is a herd of cattle, with dark beer, and cherries... Mmm."
"I'm going this way. Do not follow me. Please."
"I made this hammer. It was so good I named it... Hammer."
"I will go over there. It looks quiet. It will be nice."
"Name's Ornn. No further pleasantries needed."
"I have fur. It is soft. Do 
not
 hug me."
"The Freljord is a place for building, fighting, and eating. Home sweet home."
"If all goes well, our paths will never cross again. It never goes well."
(Ornn sniffs.) "Singed fur... Jealous blood... My brother is near!"
"Volibear is near... Everyone seek shelter!"
"I cannot choose my brother, only the weapons to slay my brother."
"It is childish to favor one tool over another, but hammer is my favorite."
"Humans have done some things right: beer, dark beer."
"Once a human kneels, they rarely stand again."
"My forge is my home."
"I do not need company; only a wall, to keep out company."
"Once I made a harpoon out of a mountain and a world tree. That was a weird century."
"Bah, look at all these lazy trees."
"Backbreaking labor is life's greatest pleasure."
"The other gods don't understand me. Hmph, good."
"The last time I ate a plant was never."
"My work speaks in the roar of flame and the ringing of steel."
"I will make an axe that is also a sword. And possibly a spoon."
"Everything is better when it is molten. Lead, iron, chocolate cake."
"I had followers once. They tried."
"Luck is failure that failed."
"I enjoy being alone. Fewer unintended casualties."
"The Freljord forges men out of... whatever children are. Dirt, goblins."
"Ornn builds things, go see Ornn. Nobody ever says thank you."
"This world has potential. Needs hammering."
"Gods do not need followers. Followers need gods."
"Solitude always meets my expectations."

"Hmm... Noxian granite. Respectable choice."
"Walls are fine."
"Could do without the statues."
"Decent stonework."
"Huh, loose cobblestone. Will fix later."
"The architecture here is not wholly terrible."
"Hmm, this river needs a dam."
"I did not want to cool off, but this feels nice."
"Volibear made the first river. You do not want to know how."
"Your job is not dying."
"You remind me of a young me, who was less impressive."
"Huh. You are not entirely an arse."
"Working with you is almost like working alone. Almost."
"Something you should know about me..." (Ornn grumbles.)
"Whatever you want, the answer is go away."
*Ornn grumbles*
*Ornn grumbles*
"I don't know what you do and I don't care."
"Your base is that way. Go cower in it."
"I do not care at all."
"This is a waste of my time."
(Ornn grunts, annoyed.)
(Ornn sighs.) "I do not care at all."
Ornn grunts and hums as he fries an egg in his hand, then yells in frustration as a poro eats it.
"Buy a joke book. And a clown."
(Ornn grunts.)
(Ornn grunts.)
"I now like you less. I did not think that was possible."
"Stop it."
"No."
Ornn laughs.
Ornn laughs.

"Enough!"
"Hold still!"
"An iron will must be forged!"
"Good! Yes!"
"I will hit you until minerals fall out!"
"Eugh! Even my beard is angry!"
"Anvil time!"
"Hold my ale."
"That's a whompin!"
"This is called building character."
"Nose! Meet grindstone!"
"This will ring nicely!"
"Ahhh, hitting relieves stress."
"Fighting is my first language."
"Good! Yes!"
"You are a nail."
"Nose! Meet grindstone!"
"I have a hard head."
"I was working!"
"The work is the reward!"
"Now this I like!"
"Hammer never fails."
"You like that? I do!"
"I don't like the look of that thing."
"We never talk. Might as well fight!"
"Your sword has no counterbalance!"
"Give me the ale and no one gets hurt."
"Stop building!"
"My hammer is better."
"I do not like you."
"This is for my followers!"

"Good... Yes."
"I taught Doran everything he knows."

"Ahh."
"Do not hang that on a wall."
"I trust you know how to use that."
"No exchanges."
"If you want a weapon, here's a weapon. If you want conversation, here's a weapon."
"Do not waste that."
"You will not be disappointed."
"Ornn tested, Ornn approved."
"This does not mean we are friends."
"A good axe will fell a tree. A great axe will fell an army."
"The weapons I forge do not have names. They have ambitions."
"That's a weapon. Y'know, for fighting."
"You may be worthy of that. Do not prove me wrong."
"That is what good looks like."
"That is for wielding, 
not
 for entertaining."
"I was looking at that one too."
"I didn't make that. You didn't buy it."
Ornn yells.
Ornn yells.
Ornn yells.
"Heheh, broke that real good."
"Easy build, easy break."
"Mortal craftsmanship, 
please.
"
"Whoops. Found a flaw."
"Shattered and melted."
"A strong sneeze would've had the same effect."
"Bad workmanship."
"Demolished! Easy."
"Barely touched it."
Ornn yells.
"That's done."
"Job complete."
"Mhm. Yup. Dead."
"It has not been a pleasure."
"Character built."
"Ahhh."
"Well, that happened."
"Nailed it."
"Job done! Time to go home."
"Back to work."
"That was more fun than I expected."
"Fixed!"
"That fixed everything."
"Problems solved."
(Ornn grumbles.) "We're ready Ornn... we'll be right behind you..." (Ornn grunts.)
"Just leave everything to me as usual."
"Good job, everyone."
"I'm used to this level of disappointment."
"Too much sorcery, not enough elbow grease."
"Heh, not one of mine."
"Build it again. Correctly."
"Honestly though, I was just leaning on it."
"It's always the magic parts that break."
"I've seen sturdier sandcastles."
"Hmm, cherry flavored. Not bad."
"Fuel for the old hearth-fire."
"Whatever this drink is made of, it is working."
"That hit the spot."
"Heyyy, this is pretty good stuff."
(Ornn grunts.) "I do not like surprises."
"Hmm, that all it does? Okay."
"You stay here."
"Is it on?"
(Ornn grunts.) I do not know how to feel about this thing, but okay."
"Not on my watch."
"Spy on that."
"Denied."
"Heheh! Broke it real good."
"There, fixed that for you."
"Early warning is key."
"Was like that when I found it."
"Fine! I will intervene!"
"Fire up the forge!"
"Horns first!"
"Into the fray!"
"Turn up the heat."
"Ugh. Everyone get behind me!"
"We fight now!"
"This will be fun!"
"Ready for this?!"
"Hmph. Never mind."
"Changed my mind."
"A fight's where I want to be."
"A good workman is needed."
"I swear, if Volibear is there..."
"Time to show them the horns."
"Efficient travel method. I approve."
"Hmm, this is fast, but it can't be good for you."
"I prefer walking... but, fine."
"I'll just drop by."
"They won't be ready for me."
"I love a surprise."
"Here we go."
"I'm on my way. Stop asking."
"You requested my aid!"
"Hold!"
"Hooooold!"
"Hold!"
"Hoold!"
"My horns are on the way!"
"Don't start without me!"
"You each owe me a beer!"
"Hot stuff!"
"Incoming!"
"Well done."
"I broke my beard!"
Ornn groans.
"I didn't die. My forge missed me."
"Still no water in the fountain."
"Rekindled the old furnace."
