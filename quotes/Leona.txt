"The dawn has arrived."
"I must not fall."
"Rally to me."
"Ever vigilant."
"I must not fall."
"Stay at the vanguard."
"First light approaches."
"The sun always rises."
"I will protect you."
"Chosen of the sun."
"The day is upon us."
"Pen or sword - the shield is mightiest."
"Next time, try to leave a dent."
Leona grunts as she plants her sword and shield beside her and massages her hands.
"Don't stare directly at me for too long."
"I think I broke a nail, good thing it wasn't mine."
Leona laughs.

"Stand and fight."
"Feel the sun's glory."
"They will be sundered."
"Twilight fades."
"I will break their line."
"They'll have to get through me."

"I will protect thee from the ever darkness."
"The sun has gone. But I am here."
"Stand firm in thy faith. This day, we fight as one."
"In the savage twilight, I will be our shield."
"Fell magics stir at dusk. Stay behind me."
"The russet moon gives me purpose. Let us fight beneath it."
"Two ancient orders. One above. One below."
"It is but a small thing to fight for good."
"Light will not avail thee-- my shield will."
"Light in thy eyes. The sky has opened."
"Let us put this land's evils to rest."
"'Tis the moon, ringed by a ravenous star."
"Fear not the sunless sky."
"What dark dreams may come."
"This is the path to totality."
"A Stygian fog obscures the nature of this place."
"The last light approaches."
"Cling to the twilight, lest true darkness swallow thee."
"Let our enemies win nothing but death."
"Gaze into the burning ring. Do not look away."
"Chosen of the Eclipse. That is my title."
"'Tis unnatural, this vermilion twilight."
"Long is the night."
"To face these veiled terrors, we must know them."
"Wrap thyself in the cold of an empty sun."
"Shadows hide nothing from me!"
"Our foes wither beneath a halo of blackened  flame."
"I am but one light in an endless abyss."
"This eclipse will pass; true darkness will not be so kind."
"I walk betwixt the shadow and the light, ever vigilant."
"Turn thine eyes to our patron. An eternal ring, wreathed in flame."
"My order stands against the Coven and its ancient gods. Pray it is victorious."
"What is the dawn, but a portent of the world to come?"
"The Old Gods are gone. My order has shattered their profane and hideous thrones."
"We are born on the shoals of an endless black sun."
"I have gazed beyond the heavens and know the horrors yet to come."
"Now we must choose: a world smothered in midnight, or ringed with flame."
"Minstrel of the forest, return to the Elderwood and think no more of me."
"I know of your hellish masters, Camille. But not even they can stop me."
"Fair Diana, cast away thy blade. I do not wish to end thee so."
"Foul pretender, thy delicate beauty belies a darker hunger!"
"Guardian of the Elderwood, do not bar my path. I will cut thee down if I must."
I have heard of thy kind, Death Blossom. Pray, hast thou heard of mine?
"Sylvan conjurer, what brings thee before me? I claim no quarrel with the Elderwood."
"Lissandra! Has thy craven gods warned thee of my presence?"
"Night man! I must fight thee!"
"Knight of the Emerald Chapel, hast thou come to test my resolve?"
"My mother read me stories of thy kingdom once... and of the omen of the dark."
"My oath demands your destruction. You will go no further."
"I am the bulwark against true darkness. Challenge me at thy peril."
"Wouldst thou face a knight of the eclipse? Then make your peace before the end!"
"I do not fear thee, warrior. I envy thy wild ignorance."
"I wonder what happens when one looks at an eclipse? They'll know."
"An eclipse? Where? I don't see anything."
"'Tis fine."
"A jest? Of course. For luck smiles on the foolish."
Leona grunts twice and laughs.

"An ill tiding."
"Rouse thyself for combat!"
"Thy wickedness is undone."
"Snuff out this simpering ember!"
"Interloper, I challenge thee!"
"I shall extinguish thine evil!"
"Answer my challenge, coward!"
"The sun will swallow thee."
"Twilight swells to meet us."
"Thy life is forfeit."
"I will clarify thy mortality."
"For my order!"
"The heavens divide!"
"Every sun must set."
"Return to thine hollows!"
"Face thy reckoning!"
"Curse thy name."
"Thy will falters."
"Now I will face thee."
"Pawn of the Old Gods."
"I will end thee."
"Malleus maleficarum."
"Ruin has come to thee."
"My oath shall not be broken."
"An unruly foe!"
"Evil shall be burned away."
"Thy bravery wanes."
"Face a knight of the eclipse."
"The battle is afoot!"
"Oh calamity."
"Thy body will break against my shield, witch!"
"Stop this madness, Diana."
"Meet me in battle, Death Blossom."
"Thou canst not deceive me, conjurer."
"Face my blade, sorceress!"
"Saros!"
"Lumen!"
"Egis!"
"Eos!"
"Shield!"
"Solem!"
"Aurora!"
"Silver!"
"Shine!"
"Shade!"
"Wane!"
"Luna!"
"Theia!"
"Umbra!"
"Halt, fiend!"
Leona grunts.
Leone grunts.
"Hold fast!"
"My blade be true!"
Leona grunts.
"We fall together!"
"Brace thyself!"
Leona grunts.
"Face me!"
"Into the fray!"
"Luminous rage!"
"This shall end thee!"
"Hallowed luster!"
"Open thine eyes!"
"Behold the heavens!"
"Into the darklight!"
"Celestial fire!"
"Drown in moonlight!"
Leona yells
Leona yells
"The sky opens!"
"Gaze upon the moon!"
"Season unending!"
"Argent fury!"
"Night crashes upon thee!"
Leona yells
"Cruel hearted midnight!"
"A loathsome foe unfit even for the pyre."
"The Old Gods have left this place."
"Cease thy struggles. Darkness will sing thee to thy rest."
"Go to thy degenerate gods. I cast thee from these shores."
"Our lands are safe from your eldritch rites... for now."
"The light within thee is gone."
"Rest now, in the cold of the dark light."
"Begone, Bard, and find someone else to amuse thee."
"I doubt the Old Gods look kindly on failure, Camille."
"In another life, I... I'm so sorry, Diana."
"Farewell, Elise. Such beauty is wasted on a monster."
"With thy death, Hecarim, who will tend to the Elderwood?"
"Death Blossoms wilt in the darklight."
"Return to earth, conjurer. Slumber, and be born anew."
"How grossly incandescent."
"Farewell, Lissandra. May your dark prophecies trouble us no more."
"Thy test has ended, Taric. I have emerged victorious."
"This dark sun will eclipse all evil!"
"Oh patron of light. Oh impassive eye. Wouldst thou aid thy chosen vessel?"
"Oh, silver flame. Oh, empty starlight. I beseech thee."
"Oh baleful heavens. Oh vermilion darkness. Spirit me to thy embrace."
"How cruel."
"Cant'st thou not see?"
Dying sound.
Dying sound.
Dying sound.
"The ever darkness will not claim me yet."
"I will not end. This cleansing must be completed."
"I have sworn an oath, and intend not to break it."
"Day breaks upon the battlefield!"
"You'll pay for your heresy, Diana!"
"GG!"
"Alas, the sun sets once again."
"If only I could be so grossly incandescent!"
