"All the world on one arrow."
"Coward! May you die with your eyes closed."
"Avarosa guide me."
"Lead the target."
"We will unite the Freljord."
"Swiftly now!"
"We must press on!"
"Peace requires a steady hand."
"Do not confuse mercy for weakness."
"A battle worthy of the Freljord."
"Today, the fate of our people hangs in the balance."
"The Freljord shall unite!"
"Let's see how close they can get."
"My tribe will bring peace to the North. The South should fear us."
"Move quickly, position well, and the battle is won before blood is drawn."
"I will show them the power of an Iceborn."
"We are all kin of kin. Blood of blood."
"The day our tribes are one, the world 
will
 tremble."
"I am Freljordian. Family, tribe, they are all."
"I am a Warmother. I have given oaths to few. I have taken oaths from many."
"Seek peace, but bring the tools of war."
"The bow is my will given form. I am it. It is me."
"No fate is written, except by us."
"Gods and spirits guide us. But our lives... are our own."
"There will be peace in the Freljord. I 
will
 forge it."
"My people know only cold and hardship. I will teach them peace."
"I hold a bow of true ice. I hold my heart."
"Hearthbound and Iceborn, Spirit Walker and Fireborn, All Freljordians are my kin."
"I was born into poverty, all Freljordians are."
"I will not allow us to be divided. We are one."
"They think me cold. I have seen things the Southerners cannot imagine."
"What is goodness but trying to do better than your forebears?"
"The ice is not pain, it is surrender."
"Together, we are strong. Together, we are... Avarosan."
"I do not seek the throne of Avarosa."
"I dream of a nation for my people."
"When I say Avarosa, I hear my mother, and her dreams."
"Glory to the Volibear, the Thousand-Pierced Beast. Give my people the resilience of your wilderness and the fury of your storm."
"Praise Ornn, the Firebringer. I ask for your wisdom, First Builder and Forgelord."
"Praise Anivia, the Frostbringer. Let us feel the coming of change. Grant us the freedom to travel in safety."
"Praise Kindred, the Two Hunters. Pray we see death's approach, so we may complete our labors and die with our eyes open."
"Blessed Three Sisters. Give me strength to endure what I must. Give me courage to fight who I must. Give me knowledge to see the truth."
"Bless us, Ildhaurg, Warden of Sacrifice. Protect my husband. Protect my people. If my death pleases you, let it sustain my tribe."
"My mother loved me. She fought and died trying to give me a better life. So I fight, and will die fighting, to give all Avarosans a better life."
"I have heard no better words than 'The strong must try the impossible.' This is the oath I must fulfill."
"In the north, a great chieftain is called 'Warmother'. Who but a mother has the right to risk lives in war?"
"The goddess Avarosa... I say I hear her voice. But I hear only my mother's, and mourn her passing."
"I dream of the day after the tribes are unified. I dream of no longer needing to lead."
"It is not the goddess Avarosa's glory I wish to recapture; it is our people's."
"Hmph, 'Destiny'. I have always hated that word. It is a wyrm that ruins lives and murders innocence. It is a deceiver and bringer of woe."
"I am a Warmother—a chieftain. Only because no one else will do what must be done."
"We praise the leader who unifies, forgetting it is only the unity that matters."
"What is it to lead? It is to lie. It is to preach caution even when you are elated. It is to give hope even when you feel none."
"You do not aim a bow at the target, you fire knowing where the target will be. This is vision."
"I loved my mother. I loved my battlesister. I love my people. It is because of this love that I fight."
"Clan or tribe, they will join us. 
This
 is the will of Avarosa."
"Avarosan is the tribe of many, because all Freljordians are one people."
"Avarosa speaks one truth, as all gods must. She is our dream of unity."
"The Three Sisters are a myth that has strangled our people. It is a tale of failure."
"Know this! I am Ashe! I am the bow!"
"I am Ashe, Daughter of Grena! Warmother of the Avarosans!"
"Prepare yourself, you face an Iceborn!"
"Anivia, how often have I sought your guidance? And how like a god to betray a mortal's trust!"
"Braum! What are you doing over there?! Are you drunk?."
"Gragas! Are you blind?! You're on the wrong side! Again!"
"Lissandra, the fate of our people hangs in the balance, and you betray me?!"
"You named me battlesister and kin, Sejuani. Do not make me fight you!"
"Trolls are the enemy of mankind. You will die like a beast!"
"Tryndamere...? What have you become?!"
"Shaman, I am no enemy of the old gods or Sejuani. Must we fight?"
"Ancient One, go! The Volibear is honored here, but unwanted!"
"Take a good look; it's the last you'll get."
"This is the latest in Freljordian fashion. They call it a... skirt."
"This outfit makes total sense, just look closer and think about it... less."
"So, Braum. No shirt, huh? And I don't have pants. Yay, Freljord!"
"Braum, we are winter people from a frozen land. So we must... pop it, pop it!"
"So, which one is the pig? Kidding!"
"How do you like the curves? I was talking about the bow."
"Yay, Freljord! Did 
any
 of us get cold weather clothes?"
No, really, put that apple on your head... ugh! Ah... ohh... hmm...
"I don't have to see you to shoot you... ow! Ugh... ooh, really?"
"Ha hah! Check this out... ow! Ugh, who makes a bow out of ice?!"
Ashe laughs.
Ashe laughs.

"My aim is steady."
"My arrows fly true."
"I don't miss."
"I do my best work from afar."
"Never. Lose. Focus."
"This is my warning to you."
"Thunk."
"As ice shatters, so shall you."
"You face an Iceborn."
"Flee from the cold."
"My mercy has limits."
"You face true ice. You face death."
"For the Freljord!"
"You would challenge an Iceborn?"
"Fate will treat you coldly."
"Fate did not choose you."
"Feel winter's sting."
"I was raise for war. I am Iceborn."
"I greet you, as a Freljordian!"
"Hmph. The cold does not forgive."
"I will face you, sister."
"Strike quickly!"
"Faster than my arrows? I think not."
"Stand together!"
"
This
 is the fury of an Iceborn!"
"Rain death!"
"Make it count!"
"I won't miss."
"Let fly!"
"Can't miss!"
"Arrows fly!"
"Away!"
"Reveal what is hidden."
"Lead our way."
"Show us a path!"
"Anivia guide us."
"Spirit, reveal our way."
"All that frost touches, we know."
"I AM THE BOW!"
Ashe yells.
Ashe yells.
Ashe yells.
Ashe yells.
"No one escapes my aim."
"No one escapes winter."
"No one escapes my bow."
"Right between the eyes."
"I only needed one shot."
"You fought an Iceborn. Death was the only possible outcome."
"Svaag, Warmblood, was that your best? I killed you without trying."
"Heh. Svaag, I've seen babies fight better than you."
"No sagas will mark their passing."
"Mark where they died, that was as close as the got."
"They fought an Iceborn, they died."
"Are all Southerners so weak?"
"Sejuani! Goodbye, sister."
"Die, troll. My tribe will destroy your foul race."
"Tryndamere, my love. I always suspected this would be our end."
"May the voices quiet for you, shaman."
"Man no longer needs the Volibear. Return, and I will slay you again."
"You will not conquer the Freljord! I will free it!"
"The Freljord unites!"
"Form up on me. Attack pattern Epsilon."
"Let's move out, team."
"You have your objectives."
"Be careful out there."
"Stay frosty."
"Memories are more than ones and zeroes."
"We aren't weapons, we're human beings."
"Five by five."
"Stand beside me."
"Erasing our memories only ensures we repeat our mistakes."
"Today only matters if we can remember it tomorrow."
"We will end their tyranny."
"All I need to achieve the impossible is the right team."
"The role between woman and weapon blurs."
"The source code lies."
"They cannot take our pasts from us."
"Will always trumps programming."
"My humanity cannot be overwritten."
"So long as you refuse to obey, you are human."
"Freedom is ours."
"Our will is stronger than their steel."
"This oppression will not last."
"Memories are what make us human."
"The true mission is to oneself."
"Humanity isn't a defect."
"Salvation, bit by bit."
"Each reboot, a fresh guiltless mind."
"Fresh scars remind me - I'm still human."
"Join the resistance."
"Information will set them free."
"I will reveal the truth."
"Bring it all crashing down."
"They promised us infinite possibility. They lied."
"Our struggle continues."
"My dream is freedom for us all."
"Operating at full potential."
"We will free the others."
"Resistance is not futile - it's human."
"Never trade freedom for security."
"Entering enemy territory."
"Recon mode initiated."
"Hit them hard."
"Armor up."
"Let's do this."
"I don't recall us being friends."
"Stand down or be put down."
"You don't want to get on my bad side."
"The fact that you're following orders doesn't make you any less responsible."
"If you stand in my way, you won't be standing long."
"Ugh, did I ever dress like that?"
"What are you?"
"You must be Bad Ashe."
"Good? Bad? I'm the one with the bow."
"May the best me win."
"How many lives have you given for the cause?"
"I'm counting on you to get us in, kid."
"May the odds be ever in our favour."
"You're on the wrong side, kid."
"You're smarter than this."
"You might want to stay down, this time."
"Don't let your pride get you into trouble."
"Your code will get you killed one day if you aren't careful."
"Your skill is an asset to the cause."
"You once fought for honor."
"You sacrificed your honor for power."
"I demand satisfaction."
"I knew there was hope for you."
"Look sharp."
"Joining us was the right decision. You'll see."
"You weren't the only one scarred by this conflict."
"Your blades won't save you."
"It's never too late."
"If anything ever happens to me, it's up to you to finish this."
"The light in our darkness."
"You inspire us all."
"Come back from the shadows."
"Don't let them snuff out your light."
"You were the best of us - once."
"We're your family now."
"We'll make them pay - together."
"We've all lost people we care about; it's up to us to make sure no more are taken."
"Senna would be ashamed of what you've become."
"Purify thyself."
"You're better than this."
"They have your brother, but he is not beyond saving."
"You disgrace yourself once again."
"They warned me not to trust you."
"Once a traitor, always a traitor."
"I'm glad you're on our side."
"Don't think you are, Yi, 
know
 you are."
"There is more to life than order."
"There's still good in you. I know it."
"Remember who you were."
"Your spirit is stronger than their programming."
"A weapon just needs the right hand to wield it."
"With you on our side, their days are numbered."
"Our greatest enemy is now our greatest asset."
"You gave up everything you were, and it still wasn't enough."
"You are but a shadow of a man."
"It's too late."
"You're part of the problem."
"You represent everything I despise."
"Who would willingly do that to himself?"
"I thought you'd be taller."
"Remember and rise up."
"Your upgrades won't save you."
"AVAROSA, guide me."
"At four-hundred feet, turn left."
"Thanks, AVAROSA."
"AVAROSA, how much longer will this match go on?"
"For you, not long."
"Okay, that's ominous."
"War. What is it good for, AVAROSA?"
"Absolutely nothing."
"Say again?"
"AVAROSA, read me a haiku."
"For untapped power, humanity must be lost, dare we step forward."
"Well played."
"AVAROSA, read me a haiku."
"An inane request, you've got to be kidding me, hope you're satisfied."
"Well played."
Ashe laughs.
Ashe laughs.

"These sons of man are relentless in their cruelty."
"A showdown at high noon? How delightfully antiquated."
"Hm. I suppose that settles that."
"Do your ancestors proud."
"I will face you, sister!"
"A battle worthy of Freljord."
"GG!"
"More like 'the man with the open grave'."
"Heaven is empty and all the angels are gone..."
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.
