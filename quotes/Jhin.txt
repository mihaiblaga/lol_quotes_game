"In carnage, I bloom, like a flower in the dawn."
"My genius will be understood - eventually."
"Our performance begins."
"The stage is set."
"I suppose I must make do with this tawdry setting."
"This stage is beneath my talent, but I shall elevate it."
"I will bring them an opera of death."
"And now, the curtain rises."
"The work is what matters."
"Art requires a certain cruelty."
"The end is important in all things."
"My audience awaits."
"I must wait until the composition is perfect."
"They're puppets. I pull their strings, and then they dance."
"My genius will be understood - eventually."
"Art must exist beyond reason."
"They call me mad. All artists are mad."
"I will not suffer this ugliness."
"I cannot be good. I must be  perfection ."
"Every element must be in place."
"I'm misunderstood. Beauty can't be evil."
"This performance needs more... zazz."
"It's so difficult to work under these conditions."
"My talent justifies all actions."
"I am at my best only during the performance."
"I am pure. My work is pure."
"My theater is the mind."
"Art should terrify."
"No poet's words could match my craft."
"Death should never be quick. It should be an opera."
"I shall choreograph this affair."
"What sweet sadness is killing?"
"The world is cruel. It does not have to be ugly."
"Everyone wears a mask. I just chose to create my own."
"This art is a compulsion. I cannot resist it."
"Perfection isn't good enough."
"Behind every mask... is another mask."
"There is nothing for me but this."
"I never hurt anyone. It is the performance that kills."
"Until they stop me, I will keep going."
"I am the singer without a voice. The dancer without legs."
"Only to the audience do I show my true face."
"Each bullet is a piece of my soul. Each shot is a piece of me."
"I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time."
"I am a slave to this passion."
"My work asks questions, it never has answers."
"Which is the lie? The mask, or my face?"
"An icon doesn't have to explain himself."
"I wonder what they think when they see me."
"Yes, the gun is ironic."
"I like a violent composition."
"This would be easier if blood came in more colours."
"Let's start the show."
"The ecstasy of opening night."
"Smiles and screams, I bring both."
"If I keep getting interrupted, how can I be expected to work?"
"I was paid to put on a  killer  show."
"My clients expect the best."
"They will dance, they will sing, they will  die! "
"A costume, some makeup, a spray of blood."
"It's very simple - when I shoot, they dance."
"My critics are... usually short-lived."
"If I get this outfit dirty, I'm going to be so annoyed."
"I serve a discerning clientele."
"Death is certain, but killing doesn't have to be ugly."
"I provide catharsis for my clients, and my victims."
"I... orchestrate death."
"I get nervous before every performance, but I need that feeling."
"The moment before the shot... is painful."
"It is only when the gun fires that I am alive."
"Mmm... the ecstasy of killing."
"The trigger on a loaded weapon... it whispers for us to act."
"I can't live without the euphoria of performance."
"Happiness... is a warm gun."
"I want to feel everything. The gun makes it so I do."
"I envy silence... because I must be loud."
"You lack imagination."
"I have elaborate plans for you."
"Killing you will be one of my finest works."
"You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you."
"Only my actions will make you memorable."
"It hurts so good..."
"You only understand harmony. Discord is required for contrast."
"My dear countryman, you remind me how little our culture has advanced."
"I am avant-garde - you are stuck in the past."
"The Noxian invasion should be a wake-up call. We need more elaborate productions."
"I do what others will not. That alone is innovation."
"I've been asked to do so many boring performances in your nation."
"Your people mistake loudness for import."
"Noxians treat killing as a sport. It is an art."
"How gauche your nation is."
"Your war was an impressive production, but it lacked soul."
"Wait for your cue! You're only here to herald my entrance."
"What a terrible arrangement."
"You shoot to kill, you better hit the heart."
"You shout and throw machetes? How quaint."
"Clearly you've never performed in Ionia."
"I find your work very, very... obvious."
"The always-enchanting tale of star-crossed lovers."
"When you speak, I don't hear god, I hear an idiot babbling."
"Here's the thing, I don't need your god, I need more time for my production."
"You can take my soul... if you'll shut up."
"There is such a thing as 'too much gold', my dear."
"I thought diamonds were a girl's best friend."
"So many guns, all lacking in meaning or artistry."
"Your finale will be a duet."
"Your story is revenge with guns  and  ghosts. How droll."
"While you're here, consider a wardrobe upgrade."
"I suppose you embody a primitive minimalism, but you lack my technique."
"I remember your father! He thought he could censor me."
"I have been planning your final performance for a very... long... time."
"You helped lock me away. You tried to stop my work. My art cannot be contained."
"Your father was a merciful man. Only his failure will be remembered."
"Your father's death denied me a performance. You will be his stand-in."
"Break a leg! Hehe, oh. 'Break a leg', hehe... ah, delightful. I do cut myself up."
"Your music lacks the cruelty of a masterpiece."
"You should learn the power of silence."
"Step out of my light! They call it background music!"
"Your work will be forgotten. I am ahead of my time!"
"How inelegant your words are. Surely a fool wrote your script."
"You have too many lines."
"Why would anyone listen to a creature so ugly?"
"Heh... hehe... that hat is ridiculous, now... who let you wear that horrible thing?"
"Oh, before you ask, yes, your whole ensemble makes you look fat. Very fat."
"You wanted to kill me back then, didn't you? You will learn - art cannot be killed."
"You think you can stop my performance?"
"An understudy can't upstage me."
"I remember your master. He was worth remembering."
"You were wrong to kill your master. I needed him for this performance."
"You belong in the shadows. No audience could love you."
"I offer an exclusive service. You'll find I murder the competition."
"Only perfectio-gah!" (garbles incoherently) (clears throat) "... only perfection is acceptable."
"You will be poetry."
"You will be beautiful."
"Watch my puppets dance."
"This is your curtain call."
"Your life had no value before me."
"I feel inspired."
"Art is worth the pain."
"Beauty is pain."
"I will make you famous."
"You  will  perform."
"This is my love."
"Each bullet is a song."
"Each bullet will be a dance."
"How can we make this fresh?"
"Fabulous."
"Smiles, everyone, smiles!"
"Places, please!"
"Delightful!"
"Alright!"
"Wonderful."
"The composition needs something."
"Sublime."
"Transcendent."
"Divine."
"Darling."
"Precious."
"Symmetry is so boring."
"I've outdone myself this time."
"When they find you, they will cry."
"I will touch your heart."
"They're gonna live, until they die."
"This is my calling."
"Places everyone, places!"
"Shall we dance?"
"Sing for me!"
"I rehearsed this!"
"There is no drama in a peaceful death!"
"Dance for me."
"Right. On. Cue."
"Inspired."
"The show never ends!"
"How lovely!"
"Center stage!"
"I couldn't miss your performance."
"One!"
"One."
"Two!"
"Two."
"Three."
"Three."
"Four."
"Four!"
"Four!"
"You... inspire me."
"You will learn what beauty truly is."
"Through my work, you shall transcend."
"Smile! Everyone is watching!"
"Breathe in the atmosphere."
"Bliss comes only in the moment before I fire."
"There is art here, waiting."
"I inspire action."
"One, two, three, four, two, two, three, four."
"This... passion... compels me."
"Now  that  is what I want to see."
"Art shall blossom from your fear."
"Life has no meaning, but your death shall."
"I live for the applause, you will die for it."
"I knew you would find your mark, eventually."
"You've awoken something deep inside me."
"Face the crowd, and bleed for them."
"The face of your killer is identical to mine."
"With my technique, killing blooms into artwork!"
"Prepare... for your finale."
"Your final scene begins."
"Kill Noxians and get paid for it? What's not to like?"
"People scare better when they're dying."
"The truth comes only at the moment of dying."
"It's better to be above ground doing this than below ground doing nothing."
"I like the way you die, boy."
"It's fun to kill a man, to take all that he had, and could ever have."
"I love to perform, but I hate crowds."
"These were clearly designed by a caveman."
"The essence of a thing is found only in its absence."
"I always execute with style."
"Gold is my power colour."
"We all wear masks. Mine are just better-crafted."
"Ionian footwear. Sadly, so obvious."
"Sometimes, silence is loud."
"I prefer my equipment to make a bang."
"Not sure I needed another mask, but oh well."
"Art is such a fickle thing."
"Start the music. I will make them dance."
"Rapid fire? Huh. Where's the drama in that?"
"The storm is in their hearts. I calm them."
"It is by my will alone I set my mind in motion."
"I do prefer my work to have a brisk tempo."
"Red  is  a primary color."
"I have a thirst for melodrama."
"In carnage, I bloom, like a flower in the dawn."
"I have risen from the filth and muck. I am the lotus blossom. I am beauty."
"That delightful moment before the curtain goes up."

"The Stars are watching us."
"The curtain rises on a young and vibrant universe. An audience worthy of my talent."
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star."
"Mmm, my art transcends creation."
"All of you are my children, the children of silent gods."
"Eternity, molded by my hands"
"Oh to create, to destroy, these alone mean nothing."
"A single bullet to shatter the mirror of my own godhood."
"There is beauty here, hidden beneath existence."
"Absence is the only untainted perspective."
"Why erase everything at once, when it can be savored."
"The universe will end, but I will make it wondrous."
"What is a God, without words to fear him?"
"The dark star demands perfection."
"That moment of collapse. Ah, beautiful."
"I can see them all, these infinite astral workings."
"This hunger is my obsession."
"I must keep working!"
"All the stars in the sky."
"Existence, is agonizing."
"I want to feel everything, and then nothing"
"I am the artist and I am starving! "Art should devour us all."
"My stage is the endless abyss."
"I provide the gift of a dazzling...extinction"
"There is a certain elegance, in annihilation."
"Space is not silent, it dances, and it... screams."
"Oceans of formless time open before me and they whisper, Jhin, we are your true face."
"The stars are my eyes, and one by one, I must blind them."
"Mortals and their linear time, they appreciate my art, they have no choice."
"What do I erase? Myself, in every performance"
"Destroying galaxies is a pedestrian interpretation, I paint upon the canvas of eternity."
"What lies beneath my mask? The universe, as I, was meant to make it."
"Aurelion, it is endearing that your kind's work remains uncompromised by taste"
"Go frolic amongst your starlight you sad empty little thing. A   artist is at work"
"I won't be revisiting my... previous work, Your Highness, but I do have something exquisite planned for you."
"To work on such a small stage Rakan is, mmm, well, maybe it is fitting."
"Every universe, every Xayah, a spark... destined only to fade."
"You corruptants are all pale imitations of a true masterpiece: the absence of everything."
"Karma you were formed from a pacifist star system? *Jhin chuckles* ,How incredibly droll."
"Everybody loves a clown."
"You see yourself as some poetic genius, Thresh.  I know you for the hack you are!"
"Yes Varus, you contain multitudes, but it's quality over quantity. Quality over quantity."
"Killing galaxies Zed? How plainly derivative, allow me to make you part of something greater."
"Fate holds an interest in the crew of the Morning Star, but fate ends where I begin."
"Orphaned and alone Rhaast, a mere refraction of a refraction. Not you boy, you mean nothing."
"That orb is tacky, Templar. I'd get rid of it."
"Oh Shen, tsk tsk tsk, look at you. Broken composition, uninspired perspective, and a ghost sword."
"You are all dancing in the palm of my hand."
"Just a snap of the wrist... and everything's gone."
"I must fill this emptiness."
"Oh, don't worry, I'll make sure you see everything you wish to see."
"Yes, no, I want you to know, stop resizing, why are these here, ugh."
"Big, small, big, not that one, not that one."
"I suppose a nervous jab or 'FOUR' is apropos in these moments."
"I know... only love."
"This is my passion."
"An echo of timelessness."
"Art in application!"
"Divine inspiration!"
"The stars align."
"My pattern will flow from your emptiness!"
"This is my grand design."
"The stars compel me!"
"Space sings only for you!"
"I will make you whole again."
"Eternity awaits!"
"Hear the music of the spheres."
"Angelic!"
"Transmundane arrangement."
"Heavenly."
"I am nothing if not merciful."
"I have shown you beauty."
"How blessed it is to be chosen."
"Your molecules sing to me."
"You will dance!"
"I will connect you to everything."
"Do you wish to see my face?!"
"A star is born."
"How radiant!"
"What bliss!"
"You must embrace infinity."
"Are you not moved!"
"I wouldn't miss this for the world."
"Transcendent."
"Timeless."
"It has a primordial quality."
"Sibling, you don't compare to me, and will not get in my way"
"My Queen, see what I've become."
"I am what all corruptants were meant to be."
"Thresh, I have suffered enough of your hackery."
"I could use some gold in this composition."
"One."
"One."
"Two!"
"Two."
"Three!"
"Three!"
"Four."
"Four!"
"Four!"
"Four."
"Four."
"We are alone now, the stars and I."
"Where will we spend eternity?"
"I must erase everything, the audience demands it."
"You are not separate from all that is."
"This is but a fragment of infinity."
"Don't close your eyes, I want you to see."
"How close you are to divinity."
"This is the road to paradise."
"I inspire everything."
"You fear erasure, but that's why I chose you."
"Art springs eternal."
"I must feel this emptiness."
"If only you could see what you'll become."
"There it is."
"Entropy cannot be reasoned with."
"In an endless abyss, there is only you"
"Erasure is perfection."
"I am infinite."
"You have gone, beauty is all that remains."
"This is the providence of god."
"Who are you now, what will you become."
"But... how does it... feel? "Oh, to be one... with eternity."
"From your dust all things are possible."
"Erasure is the pinnacle of art."
"Cheap materials, very little artistic value, cosmic garbage all over my stage."
"Do you like it? You're an art lover. I know you understand."
"What could you become? A neutron star? A red giant? What does Rakan mean? Tell me."
"You can't fight providence Xayah, you can only  "
"The dark star is an incomparable muse, and you have squandered its gifts"
"You never understood the value of the work Thresh, and therein lies the real tragedy."
"Varus, I've cut your layers away, and underneath revealed light."
"You opened that... gate? Excellent. I could use a change of scenery you know."
"Oh, Zed, you were perfect."
"Your pedestrian dreams of greatness are ended gentlemen."
"I liked your forebears, Sona. They're all dead but they had excellent taste."
"Now this is a proper show!"
"In darkness, I dream of a cold and silent world."
"I am the black tongue, a God without his throne, my mouth opens, and the stars pour in"
"The final fated moment before the curtain falls."
"But, is it... art?"
"What will... I become?"
"Divinity cannot be censored."
"My performance begins anew."
"Even if the artist dies, his contributions persist in all things."

"Behind every mask there is a face, and behind that a story."
"Behind this mask... is another mask!"
