"You want style? You've found her."
"Eh, I could do better."
"Name's Samira. Try not to slow me down."
"If you can't keep up don't step up. I don't have time for fools."
"Listen up, you sorry lot! Only one rule for this mission: take no prisoners."
"I've got two rules for every fight. Don't ask for permission, don't ask for forgiveness."
"The term's PsyOps, short for Psychic Operations. My name's Samira, short for styling on idiots."
"High command,  BRG . Whatever! I go where the thrill goes."
"Refugee, mercenary the inspiration of a generation!"
"Virtues? I've got a few. Vices? Heh, a few more."
"Some choose steel. Others, bullets. Why not both?"
"In every girl, there is a queen."
"I am the beauty and the beast."
"Only need one eye to hit my mark."
"Well-behaved women don't make it in Noxus."
"I'm not built to win. I'm built to conquer."
"Oh, how great it would feel to shoot my past in the face."
"Heh! Nothing more lethal than comfort."
"I don't work. I slay."
"Last person I loved thought I was too reckless. Their loss."
"I never go out of style."
"Hope I get some blood on these boots. The color's a bit dull."
"Danger runs from me."
"The empire values strength. I value style. We're good partners."
"I'm the rose that survived the desert."
"'Refugee.' That label is where I draw my strength."
"Money buys a gun or two. Thrill buys a reputation."
"Why be average when I can be savage?"
"I feel most alive when I'm walking the line."
"Guns and swords go together like rice and saffron."
"The ascended think they own my people. They are wrong."
"Life's simple. Take the shot or lose the chance."
"My folks keep telling me to settle down. Not my style."
"Thrilling! Ha! Maybe I'll get a tattoo to celebrate the occasion."
"If they think I kill for fame and fortune, ha! They're idiots, just like all the others."
"I chose this life. And sure, someday it might get me killed... but 'til then, I'm unstoppable."
"Those who followed the ascended burned away my home. So don't expect me to follow anyone."
"Indari was a great captain. She taught me how to shoot. I taught myself how to kill."
"I care most about my warband or my family. Order changes depending on who gets on my nerves."
"Born in Shurima, raised by Noxus. Maybe I'll die in Demacia to make things interesting, huh?"
"People always ask about my weapons. Right hand, Blaze. Left hand, Thorn. Vanquish on the back, eh! Simple as that."
"Sometimes, I'm the hero. Other times, I'm the villain. It's all a matter of perspective."
"Growing up, my mamman taught me one lesson. Death isn't the scariest thing. It's a mother's rage."
"Darius, Swain, pft! Those names mean little to me. I answer to myself."
"The sad mummy! My mamman used to tell stories about you when I was a girl. How I loved them."
"Shurima needs no emperor!"
"I know your type, Draven. The kind of man who's compensating for something."
"That gauntlet would be better off without you, kid."
"You seem kinda pale, LeBlanc. Sure you're getting enough sun?"
"Sarah, is it? I've killed many captains. Let's see how you measure up."
"A talking turtle? Okay, maybe I did have one too many."
"Sivir. You say you'll do anything for the right price, but what's the price of one's destiny?"
"Hey, old man. How long you got before that demon takes over?"
"Honestly, lantern man? Not sure you can handle my soul."
"If it looks like a blood sucker and it sounds like a blood sucker... Maybe I ought to kill it."
"Xerath. Your people ended my home. I will end your existence."
"Keep the change. You're gonna need it."
"You're dead weight."
"Buy something nice. On me."
"Get a haircut. Trust me."
"It's alright if you don't like me. We can't all have good taste."
"Huh. Less than yesterday at least."
"Hm. How come no one ever tells me to reload?"
"Oh... I really gotta check these more often."
"Ugh. I missed a freakin' cliff-diving trip for this crap?"
"Let's make this fun!"
"Push my limits! I dare you."
"Finally some action!"
"Oooh you look promising."
"I'm bored. Fight me!"
"I fight on my terms."
"Don't hold back. I won't."
"Well! Look at you."
"I'll take care of this."
"Seize the moment!"
"Oh lookie here. Target practice."
"And I'm not even looking."
"Don't mess with me."
"You're mine."
"Next breath might be your last."
"Bah! Like tereshni all over again."
"On my worst behavior."
"Came all this way to die? Hm?"
"Think fast!"
"Always bet on me."
"Settle down sweet-cake."
"Push off."
"Nope!"
"Don't think so."
"Nice try."
"Over here!"
"Eyes up!"
"Keep up"
"Too slow!"
"Woo!"
"Jackpot!"
"Showtime!"
"My kind of rain!"
"No better time to die!"
"Never look back!"
"Weapons hot!"
"It's about to get messy."
"Flawless."
"Idiot."
"Not sorry."
"Done and dusted."
"Lucky for you the last thing you saw was me."
"Messy, but effective."
"Oh! Did I step on your moment?"
"My time is precious. Your life is not."
"Ha! I win."
"Maybe you should've smiled more."
"Eh, I'm not here to make friends."
"Don't worry, Azir. You'll be remembered... as a tyrant."
"Ah... what was your dumb name again?"
"Leave the kid, take the gauntlet."
"Not the first LeBlanc I've killed. Probably not the last, either."
"Your guns have a better home now Sarah."
"Not sure if I just killed an ascended or some kid's lost pet. Ah, well."
"Guess you don't need to run from destiny anymore, Sivir."
"Be thankful I got to you before your demon did."
"Don't say I didn't warn you lantern man."
"Ugh, gross. Least my boots are looking brighter."
"Shurima, no, the world is better off without you, Xerath."
"Ohoho I'm just getting started!"
"This took years of practice... for everyone else."
"Taking a quick break. Try not to die while I'm gone."
"How did that old trick go again? Ah, right."
"Gonna go grab a drink! And maybe buy some new toys huh?"
"Be right back. After all, I gotta save some killing for later."
"Target neutralized, credits obtained. Time to treat myself."
"Style never fades..."
"Least I didn't die of boredom..."
"Believe me, I've faced worse."
"Live fast. Die young."
"Another round. Ante up!"
"Look out, guys, gals, and other pals. Samira's back!"
"I'm sorry! Did I step on your moment?"
"Nero, go! You're just dead weight."
"We never go out of style."
