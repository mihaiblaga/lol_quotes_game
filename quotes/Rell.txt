"Nothing gets in, no one gets out."
"Weak."
"Run 'em all down! We're good, they're bad, and that's all you need to know."
"This 'little girl' is about to crush some heads."
"Fight like you mean it. Die for something that matters!"
"The armor keeps the world out. The lance does the rest."
"I'd rather break rules than people, but I can make exceptions."
"I'll twist Noxus until it snaps."
"I fight for the lost. But mostly, I just fight."
"Bones shatter and people lie, but I can always count on iron."
"If I trusted people, I'd need even more armor."
"The helpless fight. The hardened live."
"Friends just get in the way."
"Don't let anyone in. Never let anyone in."
"The Black Rose may have done this to me, but Noxus knew."' "Hurt me enough and I'll split your head open."
"Noxians aren't the heroes they think they are."
"I survived the academy. My 'instructors'... didn't."
"Everyone who's ever stood in my way is dead or broken."
"Forge your heart into something strong, unbreakable."
"Trust is a luxury no one can afford."
"They call it ferromancy. Metal magic."
"The Rose wanted me to be a weapon. Well, here I am."
"I'll finish this fight. I'm the only one who can."
"These sigils are a reminder. Screw my sigils."
"Memories suck."
"Forgiveness? Never."
"They'll pay for what happened to me. Noxus, The Black Rose... everyone."
"When steel crashes against steel, it's so loud. I almost forget."
"The Rose ripped the magic out of my friends and put it into me. I hate them."
"The people who hurt me are dead. All but one. My mother."
"Those academy kids are still out there. I'll find them all. I'll save them."
"Hey, snake. I'm gonna crush your bones."
"You know my dad, General. So you know what's about to happen."
"O...Oh. So your name's Ekko? That's... that's cool. I'm cool."
"Bet the rose would sure hate losing their pet bug."
"You know I can see you, right? Gross little gerbil man..."
"Hey, LeBlanc! Tell my mom I'm gonna rip her head off!"
"All right, Rell. Be cool. It's just a tall, super-strong armored lady."
"You're Mordekaiser, right? All metal. I can take you."
"Samira. If you're looking for me, here I am."
"You're cute, Seraphine. Uh, well, bye."
"More like the boss of having his shirt off. Oh, I think he heard that."
"Noxus will fall, Swain. Starting with you!"
"Iron body, iron will!"
"I refuse to be broken!"
"How 'bout you say that again?!"
"Weeeeeeee."
"I'm the happiest girl in the world."
"Boo, you suck."
"Now I'm mad!"
"This is gonna suck for you!"
"Hey, idiot!"
"Sit down!"
"You're too soft for this!"
"Oh, we're fighting!"
"You got a problem?!"
"They'll find you in pieces."
"Hope you brought an army!"
"I'll bust you down to scrap!"
"Guess we're doing this!"
"I don't move for anyone!"
"I'm pissed!"
"I told you to stay back!"
"Here comes an ass kicking!"
"This'll shut you up."
"Say goodbye to your teeth!"
"Do! Not! Push me!"
"This is who I am now!"
"You can't fix what I break!"
"You're nothing."
"You! You're in my way!"
"Step up then!"
"Don't say I didn't warn you!"
"I will kill you!"
"Dumbest fight you've ever picked."
"This is for everyone I've lost!"
"Out of my way!"
"Alright. Die then."
"Mount up!"
"Ride!"
"Run 'em down!"
"Let's crush 'em underhoof!"
"Don't fall behind!"
"Armoring up!"
"Unbreakable!"
"Let's do this for real!"
"I'll fight to the end!"
"For the null!"
"Toughen up!"
"Get mean!"
"I got you!"
"We fight together!"
"Don't die!"
"Nobody leaves!"
"I am not finished!"
"Do not walk away!"
"Someone scrape this idiot off the floor."
"Thanks for the practice, stupid."
"Beaten by a girl, to death."
"Onto the next."
"I told you not to fight me, but here we are."
"I've kicked rocks tougher than you."
"Let's try that again. Hi, I'm Rell."
"One dead snake, one less petal on the rose."
"You shoulda kept better tabs on your people, General."
"Ugh. Just when I thought I knew him, he went back in time."
"One evil spider lady down, several evil animal people to go."
"Your lizard had the right idea. 'General-Admiral-Brigadier' Kled."
"Good. That'll send mom the message."
"I hope this won't hurt my chances, Leona. Leona?"
"Noxus was afraid of that guy? This might be easier than I thought."
"So long, Samira. Thought you'd be more stylish than that."
"We would not be good together, Sera."
"Does this mean I'm your boss now? I gotta walk away, this is too much."
"Hmph. 'Grand General.'"
"Alright, I'll admit you helped."
"I could learn to trust someone like you."
"Don't get comfortable. I work alone."
"You're dependable. I like that."
"Didn't expect the assist. Thanks."
"You'll watch my back? Just like that? Cool."
"Come on! I hate waiting!"
"This sucks! I don't have time for this!"
"All this waiting! I just want to fight!"
"I can't stop fighting..."
"Can't tell if I taste metal or blood."
"'Excellence is measured in sacrifice,' or whatever."
"These sigils are a reminder. Screw my sigils."
"Estes símbolos são lembranças. Foda-se meus símbolos."
"These symbols are a reminder, fuck my symbols."
