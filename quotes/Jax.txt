"Let's do this!"
"Let me at 'em!"
"Surprise! I'm back."
"Let me at 'em!"
"Ready for battle!"
"Bring it on!"
"It's on!"
"Here's to you, kid."
"Who wants a piece of the champ?!"
"Imagine if I had a real weapon!"
Jax laughs.
Jax laughs.
Jax laughs.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
"Who's next?!"
"Now it's my turn!"
"Bring it on!"
"It's on!"
"Surprise! I'm back."
"Let me at 'em!"
"Ready for battle!"
Jax groans.
Jax groans.
Jax groans.
"Would you look at that? I finally have a real weapon."
"How glorious! I was looking for a chance to try out my new... metal... uh, suit-Avalon! That's what it's called!"
"What have you all been up to? I just got back from killing monsters from another dimension."
"Oh good. I needed a break from defending three whole kingdoms."
"Jax of the Estercrest Kingdom at your service."
"The view from up here is incredible!"
"Look how big I am!"
"The legends about me? All true."
"Now this is what I call a warrior's stride!"
"Hey! This thing looks just like me!"
"Everyone oughta give this 'pilot' thing a try!"
"This is just what I need to get around town."
"This is the best thing since boiled eggs."
"Ah! I feel like a new Jax!"
"This Avalon better not slow me down."
"What do they call these? 'Thrusters?' They're great!"
"Make way, for me!" Jax laughs.
"There's more to me than meets the eyes."
"What can I say, I was never a fan of stealth."
"Uh, is there a bathroom in here...? Uh... anywhere?"
"I love how these... uh, 'engines' roar!"
"Now everyone can walk in the shadow of Jax."
"Feels great to charge into battle like this!"
"My footprints must be huge!"
"The lion's head was my idea. Perfect, right?"
"Three kingdoms. One Jax."
"This Avalon can barely contain my might!"
"At that battle... what was it called? The one with the red cliffs... I sank an entire fleet by myself!"
"Can't believe I used to fight with a lamppost. It'll be hard going back."
"I need a snack! Now, where can I find some rice pudding?"
"To be honest, for someone of my skill I'm not sure I need this Avalon. But don't tell my king that..."
"Now that I got this Avalon, remind me why I need a team again?"
"The first time I captained this Avalon I knew it was made for a hero."
"No one's born to command a giant suit of armor. Except me of course."
"The people say I'm the best warrior in all three kingdoms. What good people they are."
"My hobbies include saving people, defending kingdoms, and eating eggs boiled at optimal temperatures."
"As a kid, I dreamed of leading armies into war. Now, I live out my dream inside a giant metal machine. Amazing."
"What fuels this, you ask? A little bit of monster essence and a whole lotta' Jax."
"Remember: it's not the Avalon, it's the Jax inside the Avalon, bringing it all together."
"Back in my kingdom, we had way more monsters to kill. Come on! Where are the monsters?"
"Spinning axes, crass barbarian, hmm... what's your name again?"
"Leona, matriarch of the Dawnrise Kingdom, I look forward to besting you in battle."
"Sett, this won't be like one of your barbaric fistfights, I actually have talent."
"How many spectral soldiers must you hide behind Azir?"
"Garen, broad shoulders do not make a warrior."
"Garen, warlord of Vercentia. Did you ask your meemaw for bigger pauldrons?"
"Jarvan, I will pursue you until your death."
"Katarina, another princess turned assassin. I've defeated too many of you to count."
"Nidalee, the spirit of the white tiger. It'll be my honor to face you in combat."
"They call you the god of war Tryndamere, allow me to challenge that title."
"Your jade gauntlets are pretty, Vi, but will they prove useful in battle?"
"I've heard the fables, Xin Zhao. Show me the power of a 'tiger general.'"
"Riven, let's see if you can command the fire of dragons."
"Show me the might of the shadows, Talon."
"You, sir, look strong and handsome. Let's fight!"
"Kid, you're a true warrior."
"I was really hoping to test my Avalon on someone of greater importance."
"I can't believe I have to waste my new weapons on you."
"You stand between me and my nap time. This won't end well for you."
"What was that? I couldn't hear it over the sound of my awesome legacy."
"I like my action the way I like my eggs: hard-boiled."
"Little known fact, peeling eggs takes longer than saving kingdoms."
"My happy place is peace, quiet, and a boiled egg."
"Haha! Tell me another one."
Jax laughs.
Jax laughs.
Jax laughs.
Jax laughs.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
"Let's see how these weapons feel!"
"Ha! An ant stands in my way!"
"Fight me! My kingdom demands it!"
"Are you shaking yet?"
"Say hello to my giant friend!"
"Opportunity amid chaos!"
"At least leave a dent!"
"Giant Jax comin' through!"
"By the mandate of heaven!"
"By royal decree!"
"Time to smash"
"For Estercrest!"
"Surprise! I never left!"
"I could beat you with a lamppost!"
"Allow me to demonstrate the art of war!"
"My new mace wants to meet you!"
"I'll make the earth quake!"
"Witness the best!"
"You lookin' to get crushed?"
"Don't worry, I'll hold back."
"Impress me!"
"You look small from up here!"
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
Jax grunts.
"Spin to win I guess!"
"Defense to offense!"
"I'll dodge it all!"
"Engage the counterattack!"
"I'll take them all by myself!"
"Let's see what this big red button does!"
"Maximum power!"
"Kick it to high gear!"
"A surprise to no one!"
"This was built to slay beasts far stronger than you."
"Wow! I pack a punch!"
"I feel alive! Wait, too soon?"
"New Avalon, same results!"
"That was serious damage!"
"I'm a living legend."
"I can't get over how explosive I am."
"Draven this. Draven that. Come on, nobody wants to hear that."
"Worry not, Leona. Your sons and daughters will carry Dawnrise to glory."
"Go back to fighting drunkards and bandits, Sett. You need the practice."
"An entire army, and still no match for me!"
"Maybe spend less time spinning, and more time winning! Hahaha!"
"What Vercentia needs is a leader, not an idiot."
"And now, Jarvan, your legend fades."
"Stick to killing no-name generals Katarina."
"Even the white tiger stood no chance."
"What's a god of war to a nonbeliever?"
"Maybe try bigger gauntlets, Vi."
"You died an honorable death, tiger general."
"Riven. You were not worthy of the dragonfire blade."
"Back to the shadows with you, Talon."
"Maybe use a real weapon next time."
"I am the greatest! Don't you forget it!"
"Add this to the history books!"
"To kingdoms everywhere, you're welcome!"
"What's that weird clicking sound? Better go check it out."
"Oh, right! The inventors told me to 'refuel' this thing, whatever that means."
"My kingdom's in danger! Let me save everyone before we pick this back up."
"My kingdom... carries on..."
"Tell the people I love them..."
"Huh. So that's what losing feels like."
"Darn Avalon is holding me back!"
"That definitely hasn't happened before."
"Who wants a piece of the champ?"
"Imagine if I had a real weapon!"
"GG!"
"Who wants a piece of the champ?"
"Imagine if I had a real weapon!"
