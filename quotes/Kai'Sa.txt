"Are you the hunter... or the prey?"
"You wouldn't last a day in the void."
"Here is where we make our stand. Do as I say, it's the only way if we want to live."
"This suit lives on me, it calls me home. We survive together."
"You know that feeling when your skin crawls? Like a thousand needles poking through every pore? Blood pounding through every vein? That's just an itch compared to what lives on me."
"The first time I returned from the void, it was to save me. Now it's to save them."
"Stay with me, and we live."
"When memories fade and darkness surrounds you, find the strength inside."
"My appearance may frighten you, but make no mistake: I am on your side, and we fight to the bitter end."
"Come with me if you wanna live."
"Huh, memories of my father come at the strangest moments."
"Reunions can be so bittersweet."
"Could it.. be true?"
"It smells like home here."
"Father?"
"The void has breached this place."
"The first wave is upon us."
"These creatures seek the living, even here."
"That smell... unmistakable... the void.
"I came for the hunt, but I'll stay for the fruit."
"I like it here, I just might stay."
"This skin lives on me, and hunts with me."
"Feed the beast, or be its meal."
"I was spared for a reason."
"Forgiveness is hard, but so very worth it."
"I return stronger than I left."
"Exploit their weakness."
"A moving target lives longer."
"I can make a difference here."
"I will make a difference here."
"This place is beautiful, I'm going to save it."
"This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct."
"It's a good day for a hunt."
"I came back for the others who could not."
"Hold our ground, attack them in theirs."
"Void rule number one, don't die."
"Exploit their mistakes."
"Survival means never stopping, the void knows that too."
"This suit hunts in the manner I choose."
"It's fight or flight, only now I do not run."
"Stay alert, stay aggressive."
"This world is changing... we decide into what."
"Monsters are everywhere."
"Ah, trees... How I missed them."
"Danger is real, fear is an illusion."
"Imagine a place where it's always night and you're holding faith for a dawn that never comes. I don't have to imagine. I've been there."
"The skin grows restless, it needs to feed. If it doesn't could I be next?"
"Anger is useless to me, a wound that will only continue to fester."
"I am the antidote, for the rivers of poison flowing beneath us all."
"I kill so they don't die!"
"I am not afraid!"
"I'll be your monster!"
"Power, not hate!"
"Hit and move!"
"I survived the Void, but here is where my story has its best ending."
"Get up, stand firm, strike hard."
"I won't back down!"
"The Void will not consume me, but I must act or the others will not be as lucky."
"The hunt is on!"
"I can make a difference here."
"Strike hard!"
"Just for you!"
"You're nothing."
"One mistake is all it takes."
"When I was a child I was frightened of what lurked in the dark. How silly I was. Now I call it home."
"This is why I came back!"
"Tell yourself you will live. Believe it, Kai'Sa, and you will have a chance."
"Love... Fear... Whatever it's called, it's survival that motivates everyone."
"I can rid them of these monsters, but who will save them from themselves?"
"Let go of the anger. It does not serve."
"Fear the void's sting!"
"Come on, come on."
"This is why I survived!"
"Thick skin always wins!"
"I'm back!"
"This place is too beautiful to be decimated by the Void."
"My turn!"
"Back in your hole!"
"Only a child, and no one came to save me."
"I won't quit!"
"Ahh, a cold breeze. I remember these. Reminds me of home."
"Maybe someday they will come to accept me, for now they will need me."
"The Void consumes everything, leaving only emptiness in its wake."
"My skin is crawling... the needles, the itch... time to hunt."
"Fear me!"
"It's fight or flight, only now I do not run."
"This skin taught me how to survive. I will show it how to live."
"Look closely, and your prey will show you how to kill it."
"The monsters are coming. We'll be ready. I'll make sure of it."
"Survival is an instinct we all have."
"I'll be back for more."
"You're the hunted."
"I wield the abyss!"
"Found your weakness!"
"Primary directive, kill."
"Secondary directive, maim."
"Tertiary directive, peaches."
"The hunt is binary, kill or be killed."
"The hunting ground has changed, but the hunt is the same."
"Like magnets, we are drawn to each other to do battle."
"Just the beginning."
"So this is what was before technology won, m'okay."
"You don't know what you're doing."
"I'm right here!"
"This second skin gave me a second life. I will not take it for granted."
"Metal on metal. Let's get loud!"
"You're the prey!"
"Oh, how I like a fair fight."
"You realize we should be on the same side?"
"I survived the Void. I refuse to let death in. I refuse to accept it as my fate."
"They need to listen to me. Then they would see that I can show them a better way."
"Attack!"
"My carbon fiber exoskeleton is invulnerable to micro-meteorites, reentry, and the vacuum of space. It has but one flaw: it can be a tad itchy."
"Come on, let's go!"
"Human or machine? Make up your mind."
"Some recoil at the sight of me. Underneath the shell would they see I'm just like them."
"Kill!"
"Fire!"
"My suit AI will continue to learn with every kill, but it still could use a little extra battery life."
"Hextech is a dead technology."
"Fight hard. You are a living weapon."
"Deploy!"
"Technology doesn't evolve; it upgrades."
"This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct."
"Life and death are separated by the smallest stumble."
"Engage!"
"They have found me here. Let's settle this."
"Time for an upgrade, rusty."
"Wow, time for an upgrade."
"Time to pit steel against steel."
"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe, attack ships on fire on the shoulders of Or... Are those peaches?"
"Let's see what you're made of!"

Kai'Sa kneels while a frog gets sucked into her shoulder pod, then gets ejected as a corrupted frog.

Kai'Sa laughs.
"My suit hungers."
"Foolish quarry!"
"Kai'Sa, remember the name!"
"This is my purpose, learn from me."

"A lamp's not gonna do it, Jax."
"I guess I'm next, Jax."
"Settle down, sister!"
"You want crazy?"
"You talk too much."
"Have we met?"
"You seem familiar."
"Something is off here."
"I know your tricks."
"Don't test me."
"You will leave this place."
"What are you?"
"Not on my watch, glutton."
"Vile creature..."
"Looking for me?"
"Let's set the story straight."
"You call those guns?"
"You're outgunned."
"Step back, red!"
"This is 
my
 home, void-spawn!"
"You must be lost, creature..."
"Not here, friend."
"Die, trespasser."
"I am not afraid anymore."
"Go back, 'Voidling'!"
"This is my home, void-spawn."
"This is not the void!"
"You will die here, creature."
"Come on, come on!"
"You don't belong here!"

"Ahh..."
"Ahh, clumsy girl."
"Close doesn't count."
"Do better next time, Kai'Sa."
"That was pointless."
"They got lucky."
"Dammit! Dammit!!!"
"Dammit! Take your time, Kai'Sa."
"I knew it."
"Prepare for what's next."
"Walked into that one."
"They can't get away."
"Gotcha!"
"Yes!"
"Marked by the void."
"Found you."
"You're all mine."
"Tag."
"Mmm-hmm."
"Too slow."
"Perfect."
"I am good."
"That was easy."
"Running is only half a plan."
"That'll leave a mark."
"Nice!"
"Prey marked."
"I see you."
"Revealed."
"Got one!"
"They never saw it coming."
"They'll think twice next time."
"They can run, but they can't hide."
"Yes!"
"The void's reach is long."
"Too late to run."
"Only I can escape the void."
"You can't outrun the void."
"Coward."
"I'll take that."
"They were so close."
"Almost made it!."

Kai'Sa says each of these quotes based on the number of kills she has.
"That's one."
"Two down."
"That's three."
"And four."
"That's five."
"Yes! Six."
"Seven"
"Eight kills."
"Nine lives taken."
"Ten down."
"Eleven."
"That's a dozen for me."
"Thirteen, unlucky for them."
"Fourteen."
"Fifteen ‒ and counting."
"Sixteen."
"And seventeen. Wow."
"Eighteen."
"Uh-huh, nineteen."
"Twenty! Yeaaah!"
"Twenty-one."
"Twenty-two! That's a lot."
"Twenty-three."
"Twenty-four, heh, I can't even."
"Twenty-five, come at me."
"I'm done counting."
"I forgive you, Malzahar, but I do not forget."
"You're now dead prophet, that is the truth that will be told."
"Goodbye Malzahar, now I will tell this tale."
"This is why they need me!"
"Will they now see? I can do this."
"For you! For us!"
"Yes! We did it."
"That's just the start."
"That sent a message."
"Mmm."
"Sometimes you have to stop and taste the fruit."
"Not peaches... but... they'll do."
"Ohhh how I missed these."
"What a pleasant surprise."
"Sometimes you have to stop and taste the... Honeyfruit?"
"Let them come to us."
"Vision can make all the difference."
"They will come, we'll be ready."
"All better now"
"Ah, that works."
"Thanks for that."
"I won't forget this."
"I'll take it."
"I needed that."
"That is just what I needed."
"Ahh, that's much better."
"Yes! Teamwork!"
"Nice work."
"Thanks."
"Alright."
"Whew."
"Whew, that was close."
"We're stronger together."
"You are awesome."
"Thanks."
"Nice reflexes."
"Whoa! Nice!."
"Don't be long, we're stronger together."
"Don't worry, I will fight alone ‒ I've done it before."
"I'll stand our ground while you're away."
"Look what just crawled from underneath."
"They're hiding."
"Don't be fooled."
"It's a trap, be ready!"
"I need to gather my strength."
"That's enough for the moment, the hunt will resume."
Kai'Sa dances to an instrumental version of "POP/STARS".
Kai'Sa plays a "beat 'em up" game and dances after winning.
(Screams)
"In the void I had no one. I was a doomed outsider. Here, people are everywhere, and they are all mine."
"Some call me 'Monster', they have no idea what lurks just below us all."
"The void is not so much a place ‒ it is a power, reaching out to consume all life.
"The void-spawn offer a thousand ways to die, and one way to live: Become like them."
"The things we carry should lift us up, not weigh us down. Memories, love, and hope are the lightest necessities."
"The yoke of fear is a heavy burden. Hunters must be nimble, and walk lightly."
"I grew up deep inside a vast emptiness, I do not wish to grow old in one. 
That
 is why we must fight."
"Down there I was surrounded by nothingness, but I was never alone. Memories comfort like the closest companion."
