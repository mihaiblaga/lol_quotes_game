"You cannot know strength... Until you are broken."
"Cling to hope... it is all you have."

"If they could only comprehend the truth of the Dredge... I wouldn't need to drive it into their skulls."
"Enjoy this final moment... before your trial begins."
"It is time... for them to die."
"Controlling them will be simple... with my hand around their throats."
"I detect the presence of scum."
"The machine is ready."
"Power. Fear. These are my weapons."
"A city, choking in the Chem-barons' grasp."
"Endless misery, mhm... Wonderful."
"I want to see their faces when I tear their hope away."
"Few will endure the chaos to come."
"Their future is carved into my flesh."
"I was not reborn in the depths. I merely refused to die."
"Carnage - as intoxicating as chemtech."
"If they do not stop me, they will die. It is just that simple."
"Zaun will be redeemed... in the flames."
"If you hide in the shadows, you are only drawing me home."
"The weak are condemned."
"Cast into a pit of despair, I climbed out on the corpses."
"I answer to  no one . No matter how loudly they beg."
"Where will they run when the whole city burns?"
"Screams follow in my wake."
"There is no coming back."
"I will guide you to a new age, born of destruction."
"Such marvels, built of pain."
"I am stronger than man, stronger than machine, I am an idea."
"Your fear, given chemtech and flesh."
"Their cries are calling me home."
"A new order... chaos."
"Strength... will be tested."
"Who among you are worthy?"
"This is the only truth that matters: a weapon aimed at your head."
"I am the very definition of a self-made man."
"We will rise from the rubble, stronger than before."
"Only those who survive this city deserve it."
"Think how much stronger they'll be... if they live."
"Tear their weakness away, and  nothing  is left!"
"What is strength if you do not use it?"
"Pain is the act of becoming."
"It is not violence. It is... philosophy."
"Noxus is lost."
"Piltover is a parasite."
"Think of all that you have survived."
"There is always another trial."
"Zaun welcomed me with open arms... and a knife to my back."
"Do you think me so weak as to fall for your charms?"
"My, my. What have they been up to in Piltover?"
"I must admit, I have a thing for... legs."
"The hand of Noxus can be cut off; ask your    master ."
"A pale imitation."
"My replacement? Really, now?"
"The child is learning."
"This one... has potential."
"If you feed on pain, I welcome you to the feast."
"Give me a reason to fear you."
"You defeated Noxus. For that, I will make this quick."
"I heard you like to give hugs."
"The city calls for chaos. She is but the first to answer."
"Where do your loyalties lie? I will bury you next to them."
"I hope your father begged when Swain betrayed him."
"This is not your land, and that lizard doesn't even like you."
"Let the rage carry you... into my chains."
"You respect strength. Good. Then you understand."
"Noxus failed you... when it did not punish your betrayal!"
"Caught between two worlds? I'll drag you out of both."
"You've felt my pain. Now feel yours."
"I will not kneel to a deceiver."
"Your coat isn't even as nice as mine."
"Compared to what you do, this is merciful."
"How brave of you to volunteer."
"Don't be greedy, there's enough pain for all of us."
"Beneath those gloves... you are broken."
"The only thing you enforce is limitations."
"You can die beside them, but you will never be a Demacian."
"You were made to be a weapon. Embrace it."
"This... is going to be messy."
"No, please, tell me about your religion."
"That is what I want you to think."
"Abomination, you have cheated death too long."
"Death. Could not. Break me."
"What exactly have I been killing."
"Hold on... there's something... ah, that's better."
"Urgot, hm, I highly recommend death at this point."
"But I still have so much to kill for."
"Break men to break their shackles."
"What will you do to survive?  Tell me! "
"This pain is a gift."
"Zaun, bear witness."
"The fortunate will be the first to fall."
"The barons are not your masters - fear is."
"Chaos will set you free."
"Hahaha... Is that crying I hear? Or are you mewling?"
"They put me in chains. They gave me my weapon."
"You cannot rule what I have turned to ash!"
"I will lay your weakness bare."
"The suffering is only beginning."
"Existence is torment."
"I am Zaun's reckoning!"
"What didn't kill me,  will  kill you!"
"Your cries will give voice to chaos."
"A crucible of  pain !"
"Embrace your fear."
"Pain will not betray you."
"You listen to my words, while my  weapons  speak!"
"I am not your enemy."
"Another slave to pain."
"Death will end your agony."
"Do not fight it. Shh..."
"You will thank me, between the screams."
"Steel is  stronger ."
"No more hope."
"You will know fear."
"Feel this. The pain will prove useful later."
"Life favors the strong."
"You will fall so far."
"All must be tested."
"I offer redemption."
"I  am  the weapon."
"You have already lost."
"The end is near."
"Accept what you have always known."
"Cut their weakness out!"
"Keep struggling. Maybe you can save your hat."
"Scream louder, I want Swain to hear it!"
"A duel to your death."
"Think of all the innocent barrels I'm saving."
"Let me introduce you to death."
"Tranquility awaits."
"
"
"Metal... meet metal."
"Here, kitty, kitty..."
"Your rage makes you... predictable."
"Bringing the beast to heel."
"You only have yourself to blame."
"If only you were stronger."
"Unworthy."
"Freed by chains."
"Get over here!"
"The weak  deserve  to die!"
"The world does not need gods."
"You'd think a nation of pirates would never bow."
"I am all the weapon I need."
"The walls come tumbling down."
"What'll be born of your suffering?"
"Cold as death."
"Balance gives way, to chaos."
"The stars are too far away to help you."
"Every empire falls."
"Without Zaun, you are  nothing !"
"I'll finish what the Mist started."
"The sands will bury you all."
"In the depths, we are all animals."
"The Void may learn, but not quickly enough."
"We will make Zaun great again."
"No one will shed a tear. That is why you cry."
"What kind of monster would kill a child? Oh... right."
"Stars fall the hardest."
"Say "Shurima"  one more time! "
"Those who stand behind you will share your fate."
"I considered you my equal. I was wrong."
"Noxus already had an executioner."
"Your friends are the chain you could not break."
"Frankly, I never found you attractive."
"You belong in a grave."
"Slippery, aren't you?"
"Hmph. I thought you would be bigger."
"Demacia... (Urgot laughs) Indeed!"
"I don't know what he said, but he screamed it."
"Of all the people to fail a test."
"Make way for Jarvan V."
"You chose... the wrong weapon."
"And Piltover rejoices."
"I never saw the beauty in death... until now."
"A father should be with his    daughter. "
"The storm... breaks."
"That thing spit in my eye."
"Every one of you, as dead as the last."
"Let me know how it tastes."
"I had my fill of stones in the Dredge."
"You finally live up to your name."
"Power must be earned."
"Friends to the end, how inspiring."
"As the bones foretold: a quiet,  peaceful  death!"
"You died the moment you let a god control you."
"You were the hero. Now you're dead."
"I'm sure Valor will swoop down any second..."
"A resplendent death; feathers and fur."
"Broken, again."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of those runes."
"So much anger."
"Aw, Sion. You were already dead to me."
"Not. Viable."
"No music. Only silence."
"You knew this day would  come !"
"You've betrayed me  for the last time !"
"You were never in control."
"Obedient to the end."
"You bargained away your freedom... for a frozen stick."
"I liked the old you more."
"Did you say bow, or bow?"
"Evil needs a new master."
"You could have been so much more."
"Evolution gives way to revolution."
"Blood in, blood out."
"Birds of a feather, die together."
"Impressive."
"Your strength has saved you."
"There are more trials to come."
"Sacrificed for the cause."
"Raise them up on chains. Zaun will see my message."
"You admit your weakness."
"One falls, as many rise."
"You disappoint me."
"Now, to destroy everything you love."
"At last, you know your place."
"I was stronger."
"Zaun, let this be your warning."
"Are none of you worthy?!"
"Do not waste my time."
"A pathetic display."
"Brutality. I approve."
"Was the pain too much?"
"You only prolong your agony."
"Do you feel...safer?"
"Strength comes from suffering."
"Did you think that would save you?"
"Come back when you are stronger."
"Run, if you must."
"You try to flee, not realizing... you are in chains."
"Gather your strength. Soon, I will take it."
"You die when I choose."
"Zaun calls for its headsman."
"Echoing from the depths."
"Our rise cannot be stopped."
"I must not fear; fear is the mindkiller ..."
"If you can't beat them, join them"
"You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it."
