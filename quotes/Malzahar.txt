"It is in motion."
"At once."
"We are timeless."
"Do not challenge fate's will!"
"Without question."
"Come mortal, witness your demise!"
"Bow to the void! Or be consumed by it!"
(Burps) "I think a Voidling just came out!"

"It is done."
"Mortality is weakness."
"We demand sacrifice."

"For the Void."
"Your fate cannot be avoided!"
"You shall never stop us, Kassadin."
"Your gifts should be used in service of the Void, Kassadin."
"The Void will never accept defeat."
"GG!"
