"Everybody dies. Some just need a little help."
"You don't have the heart for this."
"Demacia Rising" plays. "The mist awaits us all. Say good bye to whatever you care about."
"I got two guns. One's for what's in front of me and one's for what's chasin'."
"Ain't enough bullets in the world for all the killin' I'm about to do."
"Look at 'em all. Not even knowin' they're following me to hell."
"Fight's this way. If you're coming along, try not to die."
"If I believed in something, I'd start prayin' to it right about now."
"So, what was it like? All that time in the lantern?"
"A nightmare. Lotta darkness. Food was great though."
"Really?"
*chuckles* "No."
"You're quiet."
"What's to say? You're still cursed."
"Keep that up, and I'll curse you."
"So how's this gonna work?"
"Well, reckon I shoot something twice and then you shoot it a third time."
"Worked so far."
"You been kinda… distant since you came outta that lantern. Somethin' you ain't telling me?"
"Yeah, I met someone in there. He's a ghoul. We fell in love and made ghoul babies."
"Oh, Ha. Ha."
"How do you aim that thing? Isn't it heavy?"
"Not if you know what you're doing."
"Cause I tried to… Ohhhhh."
"You ready?"
"I aim to purify."
"Try to keep up."
"Try to be less beautiful."
"I can turn into a screaming cloud."
"Right. I'll keep up."
"Reckon, it's time-"
"-for a reckoning."
"I'll sleep when they're good and dead."
"Not too many problems a shot to the head can't fix."
"Keep your guns out, and you'll never need to draw."
"No sunshine where I'm going."
"Somethin' seems too good to be true? Probably is."
"Whatever's in the beyond... I hope it's better than this."
"There's a chill in the air."
"I try to remember her the way she was... maybe it's best I don't."
"Seen so much death I don't even notice it anymore."
"You can cleanse anything... if you have the right ammunition."
"Always save one shot for myself... just in case."
"It's not the wraiths that haunt me, it's what could've been."
"How do you kill what's already dead? With a fistful of gunlight."
"Life... phew... it's a hell of a thing."
"One shot for the years we lost, one for the love we can't get back."
"Home is where I fight the dead."
"When I kill 'em, they stay killed."
"Don't need triggers, just need a target."
"If you can't run from it, you might as well shoot it."
"Some call it magic, I call it good aim."
"I can save her...  I can save her. "
"People never really change... I need to believe that."
"Sentinel. Fancy word for someone with nothing to lose."
"You stare into the mist, and the mist stares back."
"I've missed the smell of life."
"It ain't the grave I fear... it's what crawls out of it."
"I've always fought the black mist... never thought I'd be married to it."
"Bravest thing I ever did, was getting up this morning."
"What we had, can still be. I know it."
"These guns run on fury. I never run out."
"My wife's eyes glow with spectral magic... I'm sure it's fine."
"Now when I hold her, she feels... cold."
"This ain't war. Wars end."
"Nothing as painful as seeing something good... go bad."
"Spend this long around lost souls, and you're bound to lose your own."
"If I'm going down, I'm taking all those bastards with me."
"Used to think nothing was colder than death, now I know different."
"How are you supposed to grieve... when the thing you mourn, comes back?"
"Everyone I shoot is her captor. Everyone I save is her."
"There's a right side and a wrong side to these guns. Don't wanna be on the wrong side."
"Happiness is for other folks. Best I can hope for...is peace."
"Strange place. Beats the hell out of the Shadow Isles though."
"No place for feelings in this line of work. A full heart's an easy target."
"So my wife is half dead. Not a problem. I'll just...love the half that isn't."
"You one'a them? Better kill ya to be safe."
"One of us finds peace. One of us walks away."
"I got two good reasons for you to turn back."
"Two guns, one you. Ain't likin' your odds."
"Came to kill some ghouls. Guess you'll do."
"Nothin' between you and me but gunlight."
"I'm just full of salvation. Come get it, friend."
"Senna?! Ah, hell. If I'm gonna be shot, I'm glad it's by you."
"There she goes, the love of my life."
"Looks like we got ourselves a lovers' quarrel. Happy shootin', Senna."
"That you, Senna? Uh...is this about me not makin' the bed again?"
"How's Demacia? All safe from the mist? Yeah. You're welcome."
"Hey, big fella. Try drinkin from these barrels."
"Need me to wait while you reload that thing?"
"Hey, gunslinger. I'll let you know if you hit somethin'."
"You pointin' that peashooter at me? Let's dance."
"A man can get too close to his horse, y'know."
"I ain't scared'a you, Hecarim. I just hate to put a good horse down."
"Hey, pony man! You the one that left that pile over there?"
"Nothin' I like more than a horse that ain't been broken."
"Fortune. 'Fraid I can't help you outta this harrowing."
"Let's crack you open, Mordekaiser, and see what's inside."
"Lookin' for Thresh. You a friend of his?"
"If you don't have a heartbeat, you'd best not be movin'."
"Whoever made you forgot to turn off the ugly."
"Got a little somethin' for that lantern. Two barrels of righteous fury."
"I haven't forgotten you, Thresh, and I sure as hell ain't forgivin'."
"'Chain Warden'. Mighty tall name for a sack of bones."
"Well, well. If it ain't the ugly low down corpse that took my Senna."
"Thresh. You're mine."
"No. We do this together."
"Some day, we'll hunt monsters together, Vayne, but today we'll hunt each other."
"I ain't the monster you're lookin' for Vayne but I reckon I can be."
"The mist has you in a bad way, friend. Let me help."
"I'll have no trouble killing you... and less trouble killing you again."
"We'll see how smart that mouth is when the Harrowing comes."
"Tough talk for worm food."
"And they say I have a grim sense of humor."
"This is my happy face... see?"
"Smile? ...Alright."
"No, really... I am smiling."
"I've faced worse."
"Don't duck on my account."
"Sorry I gotta do this."
"Nothin's pure anymore."
"Draw."
"Move aside, friend."
"Go on, scare me."
"Try your luck."
"Light 'em up."
"Come get some."
"H'yeah, I got a cure for that."
"Plenty for all."
"Two in the head."
"Time to put you down."
"Here comes target practice."
"I don't do warning shots."
"How you see this goin'?"
"Both guns blazin'."
"Have some peace."
"Ready for the beyond?"
"Got a deathwish?"
"Demonspawn!"
"Always primed."
"Aimin' at you."
"Nothin' left but the end."
"Gonna need more coffins."
"Hope you brought your sidearm."
"Eat light."
"This is mercy."
"Unclean."
"For Senna!"
"Cleanse in fury!"
"It ends here!"
"Ashes and dust!"
"Trust me, you're better off."
"Rise again, I dare you."
"Bullseyes."
"You best stay down."
"They never get tired of dyin'."
"For the light."
"And all lost in darkness."
"Look at us making new memories."
"Same as the old memories."
"Sometimes I see what the darkness is afraid of…"
"You're sweet."
"Yep. Reckon that's pure enough."
"Life from death."
"Getting used to it."
"
"I was aiming at them."
"I need you alive to kiss me."
"Can see how that would be preferable."
"Reckon I could use a rest, and a break from all the screamin'."
"A sentinel's gotta know when to let his guns cool."
"Sometimes the smart thing to do is walk the hell away."
"Time to make like a wraith and disappear."
"Right about now I could use some purifyin' of my own."
"It ain't ever a sin to be careful."
"Can't run from trouble... sure can delay it for a spell though."
"I failed..."
"I'll... wait for her..."
"Senna..."
"Purity... and... peace..."
"Cleanse... me..."
"The shot that doesn't kill ya, sure makes you mad as hell."
"The mist won't take me yet."
"Looks like no peace for me today."
"Saw the beyond. Didn't like it much."
"I ain't got time to die."
"Oh, someones gonna pay for that."
"Well now, looks like we got ourselves a regular posse."
"Howdy, friends. Let's show these folks what the west is made of."
"There's a thin line between good and evil. You ready to cross it?"
"Don't get too cozy, friend. We're only allies 'til we ain't"
"What in the blue hell are you doing here, Thresh? You angling for the rest of my soul?"
"Devil's here. I can feel it."
"Time to finish what we started, devil."
"My name's Lucian. My business is savin' your asses."
"They call me the man with the grinning shadow. Nice to meet ya."
"Hit the trail, friends. We got us a fight to win."
"Something's rotten in the old west."
"The only thing that matters out here is your aim."
"Devil always gets his due."
"I ain't opposed to roughing up troublemakers."
"The things I kill deserve what they get."
"Ain't no law out on the trail."
"The west is as cruel as any outlaw."
"No rest for wicked hearts."
"My shadow's getting restless."
"They call me a demon and that's what I am."
"I was branded by darkness. Didn't take."
"Trouble with the damned is...they never stay down."
"There are worse things on the prairie than shadows."
"There's a chill on the wind."
"I ain't a good man but I'm close enough."
"And hell followed with 'im."
"When you're damned either way...give 'em hell."
"Stick close to the devil you know."
"Can't shoot your way to salvation but I still try."
"A reckoning's coming."
"I can still hear the song of the badlands."
"I remember the devil's eyes red as sundown."
"Frontier's whatever you want it to be."
"Different day, different dust-up."
"Ain't no one gonna forgive me, but me."
"Keep moving and don't get shot."
"Death don't mean what it used to."
"A man's evil grows long in his shadow."
"Good is hard to come by but I do what I can."
"Don't take your time endin' this. Never liked long fights."
"These folks are small fry. Do 'em right, and finish this quick."
"Fight was easier than I thought. And I thought it'd be easy."
"This fight's a stalemate. Someone needs to make a move."
"Gotta break this even streak sooner or later. Follow me."
"Things have broken even. Time to put a finger on the scales."
"I seen my share of stalemates, but this one takes it. Let's get those greenhorns."
"Looks like we got ourselves a real standoff. I can feel my blood itchin'."
"Shadows ain't nothin' to be afraid of once you've met 'em."
"Whole world's full of men and monsters. Most are a little of both."
"Everyday the desert eats a man for breakfast."
"Ain't looking to make a name for myself. Already have one."
"Hellfire and a quick trigger finger will get a man just about anywhere."
"Killing monsters on the high plains. Ain't nothing sweeter."
"I've never been to heaven but I carry hell with me."
"I got one rule: You hurt people, you answer to me."
"I've stared in the faces of life and death. Both blinked."
"Sometimes, when it's quiet, I can still hear her. Sometimes."
"The frontier's taken plenty of lives. I'm just here to even the odds."
"Demon of the old west. Has a nice ring to it."
"Wish I could say it was good to see you, longhorn. Suppose it was always gonna end this way."
"Get your sorry hide back to Progress, Sheriff Cait. The law ain't wanted here."
"Heard there was a desperada around these parts. Didn't figure her for a snake."
"Miss."
"Howdy, miss."
"Afternoon, miss."
"Curse you and curse your damn birds you sorry heap o' sticks."
"Square up, Tin man. Let's see if you're really the future of gunfightin'."
"Desert's spittin' out varmints left and right."
"Howdy."
"Howdy, friend."
"Howdy, partner."
"Didn't realize my actions warranted your attention, Miss Fortune."
"Don't like scorpions. Big ones, even less."
"I'll rule my own soul, devil, and send you back to hell."
"Seen a lot of cheats in my day, Fate, and you're the one I like the least."
"Well, Urgot, what can I say. You look like hell."
"Yasuo. Been a while. Guess it's time to settle a debt."
"Hell ain't big enough for the both of us."
"This demon's calling you out."
"You crossed the wrong demon, friend."
"I need me a horse."
"Been saving this bullet for you, devil."
"Strange happenings, devil. Strange Indeed."
"If you're lookin' for a fight then you found one."
"I've got a badge too. Don't mean nothin'."
"That badge make ya feel tough?"
"I'm a cowboy. On a steel horse I-oh. Um..."
"Not to beat a dead horse but...where is my horse?"
"Now to ride into the sunset...Aw, hell!"
"Yeah, I hope you keep that humor up...in hell."
"Draw!"
"Draw steel!"
"Don't make me gun you down!"
"Reach for the sky."
"I'm itching for a fight!"
"You done crossed the wrong man!"
"No use runnin'."
"You're fixin' to die."
"Can't outgun a shadow."
"You just dug your own grave."
"Time's up."
"Coffin's calling!"
"Go to hell."
"You just made my day!"
"Death is a mercy."
"Never piss off a gunfighter."
"Quit runnin' your mouth!"
"One in the chamber."
"You've got a date with darkness"
"You better be a fastgun!"
"Shoot first and never miss."
"Any easy shot."
"Take it up with my gun."
"Lily-livered..."
"Yellow-bellied..."
"Sound and fury."
"Can't outdraw me."
"I do love a gunfight."
"Hang 'em high."
"You look nervous."
"Here comes the thunder."
"You'll bleed like the rest of us."
"Demons in every corner."
"Get back to the shadows."
"Got a bullet with your name on it, Thresh."
"You ain't gettin' your due just yet, devil."
"End of the line, Thresh."
"Remember me, devil?"
"Hell's expecting you for supper, Thresh."
"This one's for Senna you two-faced son of a coyote!"
"Hey, ugly!"
"Pull!"
"One for the road!"
"Got 'em."
"Can't run forever!"
"Dead as dinner."
"Frontier justice!"
"Head 'em up."
"Cut 'em out."
"Vamoose!"
"Light 'em up!"
"Try this on!"
"Knock this back."
"Open wide."
"Duck."
"Eat lead!"
"Devil take 'ye."
"Chew on this!"
"Got 'em."
"Uh-ha."
"Eheheheh."
*Incomprehensible demonic whisper*
"Hahahaha."
"Eternal damnation!"
"You are forsaken!"
"The west will burn!"
"Ashes and blood!"
"Ahahahahahahahahahaha!"
"The west is mine!"
"Welcome to perdition!"
"Rarghhhh!"
"Arghhhhh!"
"Welcome to boot hill."
"Now why'd you make me go and do that?"
"Wrong end of the barrel, friend."
"Don't stand where I shoot."
"Didn't even clear leather"
"I'll inform your next of kin."
"Rest easy, longhorn."
"You were too stubborn for your own good, Cait."
"Just when I though we were getting on, snake."
"I'm sure I'll see you soon, stickheap. Too soon for my tastes."
"One day, I'll lose that draw, Jhin, but it ain't today."
"Can't kick a pebble without hitting one of these."
"Well, Fortune. Guess bounty's off."
"Is it just me or are those critters getting bigger?"
"Well, Senna, that'll do."
"Cheat your way out of being dead, Fate."
"If you thought dying was bad, Urgot, just wait and see where you end up."
"Hope you find peace, Yasuo. Least one of us will."
"Undertaker's got his work cut out for 'im."
"Carve anymore notches and I'll run out of gun!"
"Finally, some peace and quiet!"
"Blew the doors off that one."
"Nowhere left to hide."
"Look at that. Fell right over."
"Well, I'll be damned."
"Reckon that pissed somebody off."
"Haven't lost my touch."
"Any o'y'all got a skinning knife?"
"Trail just got a little safer."
"No need to thank me friends. Just doin' my job."
"Salutations, friends! Got room for one more?"
"Name's Lucian. Pleased to make your acquaintaince."
"Well look who decided to join us: today's target practice."
"Ride 'em high, cowboy. Ride that last train straight to hell."
"Give me a minute, partner. I've got company."
"I'll be... waiting..."
"Ugh, Senna..."
"The last ride ain't ever your last."
"Can't kill a man more shadow than blood."
"Seems like hell ain't ready for me yet."
"Look at that. Died with my boots on."
"Back in the saddle."
"Glad that demon blood was good for somethin'."
"You will be purified."
"GG!"
"Senna... I have failed you... "
