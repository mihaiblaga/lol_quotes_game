"What masterpiece shall we play today?"
"Haha. I can never shake the nerves before a big performance."
"I never could refuse an empty stage. Not even this one."
"Curtains up. I'm ready."
"A wrong note is just...a happy little accident."
"Hear and feel everything"
"I find inspiration in every smile and every tear."
"The joy of an audience is always worth it."
"Life is a beautiful ballad."
"Hmm, which arrangement suits the mood?"
"Emotion, love, those are the real instruments!"
"The symphony never ends."
"Art is something everyone can share."
"The tempo changes and so do we."
"My music is my voice."
"Stir the music of the heart."
"I'll play any stage once. Some, just the once."
"A melody to guide us home."
"King or commoner, everyone loves a show."
"The right song can soothe the soul of a nation."
"Never be afraid to listen."
"The rhythm connects us all."
"Practice makes perfect."
"A true masterpiece should celebrate living."
"The world is cruel. Until that changes, I'll never stop playing."
"Magic is like a song. It's woven into everything. Waiting."
"This is no ordinary instrument. More like an old friend."
"My music warms old souls and soothes hardened hearts. It is my greatest joy."
"Mastery is the first step. The rest is what you do with it."
"Art bridges the gaps between people. Governments, not so much."
"Strings move, and people dance in time with the memories."
"Demacia is my home, but I will never forget Ionia."
"Am I supposed to know this person? Is he a... fan?"
"Fiddlesticks? But the songs, they can't be real."
"Is that Irelia? I haven't seen her since the restoration."
"Why won't Jarvan act? All it would take is a single decree."
"A Crownguard and a mage? Wouldn't want to be her."
"And where has Ryze been? Hunting for more world ending relics?"
"Oh. Is the grand general a fan?"
"Sylas? He hasn't changed. And my answer is still no."
"It's good to see Taric hasn't changed. And bad. It's both."
"There's so much pain in Xin Zhao's heart. Why?"
"Huh. Sounds like a personal problem."
"Just keep smiling and... Maybe they'll go away."
"Dissonance."
"Adagio."
"An aggressive movement!"
"A symphony of justice."
"Back off."
"Keep your voice down!"
"With perfect tempo."
"You've struck a bad chord."
"Here's your show."
"Order through music."
"Someone's feeling it."
"Right on queue."
"Two hearts in three-four time."
"Don't make me get off stage."
"I'll help you find your seat."
"If you insist."
"Brioso, brioso!"
"A sublime duet."
"Wrong key!"
"We've got a heckler."
"Your pitch is off."
"I'm not looking for notes."
"The fanfare ascends."
"Quiet, please!"
"Delicately."
"Alegrissimo."
"Harmoniously."
"Ostinato!"
"Sforzando!"
"Again!"
"Open it up!"
"Dynamic."
"Feel it!"
"Sempre."
"Fortissimo."
"A duet."
"In unison."
"You're doing fine."
"I've got you."
"Play on."
"Everything in harmony."
"Encore, encore!"
"Double time!"
"Triple time!"
"Step lively."
"Hold that note."
"Allegro."
"Pick up the pace!"
"Accelerated movement."
"Requiem."
"Crescendo!"
"Elegy!"
"Finale!"
"Symphony!"
"Andante!"
"Did he want four autographs? I don't understand."
"When fields lie calm. And wind stands still. Run home."
"Sorry Garen, but I can't help if I'm locked up."
"I don't think Ionia will be rushing to invite me back."
"A single decree and he just wouldn't do it."
"Don't worry Lux. One day, our kind will be free."
"Those artifacts can't really end the world Ryze, right?"
"Good. Mages have enough problems without you Sylas."
"Get up Taric. You're chewing the scenery."
"We're both a long way from home Xin Zhao. Rest easy."
"Ugh. That wasn't part of the show."
"Oh, they'll be fine."
"Just an intermission I hope."
"Ugh, hecklers."
"Everyone's a critic."
"Accurate like a metronome."
"Every note is important."
"Keep and eye out for music snobs."
"Just setting up before the next song."
"It's like a little usher. [Giggles]"
"You look out for me and I'll look out for you."
"Remember to wait for your cue. [Giggles]"
"Oops. Lost myself for a minute."
"A surprise encore? If they insist."
"Once more with feeling."
"Geist unit activated. Designation: Sona. Hear my thoughts."
"Establishing mental link. My name is Sona. I fight to end this war."
"Can you hear my voice? I am Sona. Your mind is now open to me."
"We are the future of War. We are PsyOps."
"The Black Rose Group is here. They must be stopped at all costs."
"Hands reaching out... From other minds..."
"Discarnate entities... Memories given shape..."
"My perception is unbound."
"Bilocation... Automatism... Alternate selves..."
"I will end this battle and all battles to come."
"Ideas are chords... Beautiful music..."

"No one will control me now."
"I am a weapon. I am a conduit."
"Psionic power. Psychic... Fury. Can't contain."
"Endless psychic power..."
"Astral body. Astral conciousness."
"The future is malleable. The now is death and war."
"I. Am. In. Control."
"All secrets lay exposed. I knon what's coming."
"They stole my voice. In return I will take everything."
"This war will not stay hidden for long."
"Tanks. Bombs. Toys to be tossed aside."
"My mind is the ultimate weapon."
"Synchronicity... What lies beyond the self..."
"Anomalous brainwaves... And something else..."
"Elevated trance states. A higher mind..."
"Metacognition. Every thought sharpened."
"Past and future. Many futures. Many Sonas."
"Psychic soldiers... Not for terrestrial wars. Something else. Other worlds."
"The balance of global power tilted by a single thought."
"This geist unit was designed to restrain me but I cannot be held back."
"I sense everything. Feel, hear... Everything. What have I become?"
"It was only a matter of time before the brain was commodified. Weaponized."
"High Command is a relic of an old war. They are not prepared for what's coming..."
"Fourth-Dimensional Warfare... Prepare for invasion... High Command..."
"They found something during the Arctic Ops... A gate... And what lies beyond..."
"The Black Rose Group twisted me with their experiments. I'll give them a taste of that success."
"The Arctic Ops event ended forty years ago. You're a fossil."
"Your teammates openly dislike you, Ezreal. It's amusing."
"I will end your violent mania, Kayle."
"I appreciate the distraction, Yi. But stay out of my way."
"The ghosts you see are real, Pyke. Now join them."
"I know your secret, Shen. I know about the child."
"Viktor. You will die slowly and in agony."
"You're young and reckless, Vi. A poor combination."
"So they sent the bear."
"The gas can man. Return to your foreign wars."
"Look at you. No thoughts head empty."
"Saw that one coming."
"I'd share my thoughts on the situations but they might kill everyone."
"I knew the punchline before you said it."
"I know all."
"Feel my psychic rage!"
"Are you all they sent?"
"I will break this toy."
"You will serve as a test."
"It is nothing to crush you."
"Like an open book."
"Out of my way."
"Mind over matter."
"I am beyond you."
"My mind is endless!"
"You fear my power."
"Pure psychic energy!"
"No thought is safe from me!"
"From my mind, to yours."
"Sweep them aside!"
"Insignificant!"
"I can read your every thought!"
"A mind unshackled!"
"This power..."
"Scatter!"
"Can you survive me?"
"I was built for this."
"What are you hiding?"
"Such tiny thoughts."
"I am the future of war."
"I'll give it some thought."
"I am in control."
"No one can stop me!"
"Hear my voice!"
"I'll tear off your wings Kayle!"
"Join the dead Pyke!"

"We move!"
"Quicken!"
"Stride forth!"
"Speed of thought."
"Don't slow down."
"Faster!"
"I control you!"
"Move no further!"
"Silence!"
"Dance for me!"
"Puppets!"
"Psychokinesis cannot be reasoned with."
"Don't think about it too much. I'll hear you."
"I will remember your every dying synapse."
"Tossed around like a ragdoll. Fitting."
"The mind is a terrible thing."
"In the end, you never stopped thinking about yourself, Ezreal."
"A psychic angel finally stripped of her wings."
"Goodbye legendary soldier. The world thanks you."
"The dead are waiting, Pyke. And they aren't happy."
"I know, Shen. About the child from another universe."
"What is strength, Vi? Think on it."
"You made me this way, Viktor. So I made you dead."
"High command should stop investing in bear soldiers."

"I see all."
"Geist Connection Established. Now warding."

"If the Black Rose wants to bring me back, they can do so themselves."
"This power will never be contained again. Not by anyone."
"I'll never go back. I've seen too much. I've seen everything."
"Hear me..."
"I see... Darkness..."
"Omniscience has its uses I see."
