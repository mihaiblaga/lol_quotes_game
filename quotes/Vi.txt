"Punch first. Ask questions while punching."
"If I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you."
"Here I come to save the day... or wreck it."
"They'll never know what hit 'em."
"Let's get crackin'."
"I'm doing this 
my
 way."
"Piltover's finest."
"Plan? I don't need a plan."
"Let's get to the fun part!"
"Who needs a beat-down?"
"If you hit a wall, hit it hard!"
"Sometimes you gotta 
make
 a door."
"I let my hands do the talking."
"I'm my own backup."
Vi spits on the ground and assumes a boxer's fighting stance.
"I've got five reasons for you to shut up."
"If I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you."
"I like you as far as I can throw you... not even."
Vi takes out a teacup from inside her gauntlet, takes a sip, then throws it on the ground.
"Care for a spot of tea? Or maybe a spot of 
punch in the face
."
"Oh, look at me... I'm on the case."
Vi cups one of her hands and punches it with her other fist.
"We can either do this the hard way or... oh wait, no, there's just the hard way."
"Hmm, I like your smile. Gives me something to aim at."
"I like your smile. Makes a nice target."
"Why can't I get a straight answer? It's always just 'Oh no! Stop hitting me! Ow, my face!'"
"Welcome to the party. Try the 
punch
."
Vi laughs.
Vi laughs.
Vi laughs.
Vi laughs.
Vi grunts.
Vi grunts.
Vi grunts.
Vi grunts.
Vi grunts.
Vi grunts.
"A little smash and grab."
"Here comes the punchline!"
"Come on! Resist arrest already!"
"One girl wrecking crew."
"Freeze! Or don't, I don't care."
"Put a dent in 'em!"
"Vi, hah, stands for violence!"
"Vi stands for vicious."
"Vi stands for vice."
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
"Get dunked!"
"Eat this!"
"Boom, baby!"
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
Vi yells.
"Yeah! Teamwork!"
"High five, cupcake!"
"Boom! Headshot."
"Hey, Jayce! Power slam!"
"Nice shot, cupcake."
"Aww, was that supposed to hurt, Cait?"
"Nope!"
Vi groans.
Vi groans.
Vi groans.
