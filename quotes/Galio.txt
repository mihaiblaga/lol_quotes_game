"Time to make an impact!"
"Back to sleep, then... "
"You know what's hard about fighting? Nothing! Come on, I'm made of stone."
"I've got a high tolerance for magic. Takes a lot for me to feel it."
"As a symbol of this great nation, I say... let's go mess up some mages!"
"Know of any battles? Just looking to get my wings dirty."
"People are funny. They pass beneath me doing the same thing day after day."
"I'd like to apologize in advance for ruining this place."
"Let someone else be a statue, I got stuff to do."
"I don't wake up 'til its time to squash something and I'm awake right now."
"Ahh, feels good to stretch my wings."
"I didn't choose to come to life, but I definitely prefer it."
"I've seen much, not sure I understand it but... it... it happened."
"Hahaha, majestic? Is that what I'm supposed to be?"
"I might be made of stone, but that doesn't mean my heart is."
"I wish mountains had fists - that'd be a good fight."
"Hmm, must be some powerful magic around here."
"Somehow I always end up in the center of everything."
"The guy that made me, he was pretty good right?"
"Tragedy is worse when you can do nothing about it."
"I wish they'd chisel me a friend. Someone who won't break!"
"I know, it's completely unfair. I didn't ask to be this impressive."
"I always wonder what lies beyond this land. Something to fight, I hope."
"I am not going back on the pedestal, not yet... "
"They made me to stop magic, and yet I hate when it's gone."
"I sleep, I wake, I break things"
"Whoa, I didn't know I had a tail!"
"Do I get to crush that? Oh, please say yes!"
"I don't know why life chose me, but I'm glad it did."
"I'm supposed to be a symbol. Of what, I'm not so sure."
"It's hard to be a symbol, when you've got a soul."
"Let's move! I've got people to inspire!"
"It's not easy when everyone looks up to you."
"Can someone please get the pigeons out of my head?"
"Ah, mages. I love the way they squish."
"I don't break easy."
"I fought a house once. I'm pretty sure I won."
"People vanish! And new ones take their places! It must be magic."
"The best defense is me."
"The best offense is a good magic absorbing colossus."
"I love walking, it sounds like thunder!"
"Ah, the world, it goes by in a flash."
"It's time to move! Shake off the moss."
"I'm going, you try moving three hundred tons."
"They just don't make doorways big enough."
"Going to sleep means saying goodbye."
"Which way's the fun?"
"What should I break next?"
"They say I'm all made of petricite, I say I'm all guts!"
"I fell in love with a crag-beast once. Oh... wasn't meant to be."
"I haven't been to many places, so I might as well like this one."
"Let  me  do the heavy lifting."
"Get behind me, huddled masses!"
"People live such tiny lives!"
"I'm a big man, with big needs."
"One people year is fifty Galio-years."
"I love Demacia! It's the only place I've been."
"At last a change of scenery!"
"Apparently I'm some sort of big deal."
"Who wants to get protected?"
"Excuse me, but... which king are we on now?"
"Greetings, giant glowing mineral! I must break you."
"Ooh, a giant crystal? I'll fight it."
"You're from space, huh? I'd fight space. Bring it on!"
"I've always wanted to fight the sun. Let's go, space man! "Hey, World Eater, I've got something you can snack on. It's my fist!"
"Dang right, Demacia!"
"Summon your god, painted priestess, and we'll see who's mightier."
"You're a Jarvan? I swear, I've met at least three others."
"You. Young girl person. Can you stay and accompany me wherever I go?"
"Hm. How strange. No-one bothered to sculpt you?"
"So, what's it like living underwater? Fought any whales?"
"I like you, small blue thing. You're the one who doesn't change."
"Back to your hole, giant crawly worm."
"Hahaha! Ours would be a fight for the ages! They'd find pieces of us for miles around!"
"You look horrid! I should give you the name of my sculptor."
"Do not raise your claws at me, furry growly man."
"Looks like I'll have to punch down. Hmph. Way down."
"I don't fight small things. Come back with something bigger and meaner."
"What awful material were you sculpted from?"
"I'm sorry, I just woke up. Were we fighting?"
"Hey, you. Don't mess with Demacia, I saw you thinking about it."
"Didn't I fight you yesterday, or was that a different puny thing?"
"Would you like to ride on my massive shoulder?"
"Quick! Hide in my crevices."
"Rest in my ample shade."
"You know, gargoyles and Yordles have a lot in common."
"Gargoyle? No, I'm more of a magic-nullifying colossus."
"Climb up here and say that my face."
"You speak a lot, loud talky thing."
"Hmph. Good thing I don't have ears."
"My middle name is Justice. Galio Justice Justice."
"I came to chew bubblegum and kick butt, and I'm all out of butt."
"You're going to need some mending."
"So... what do you people do when you're not fighting?"
"Bring it."
"Wanna go?"
"So many things to squash!"
"Not a fair fight."
"Go time!"
"Smash."
"Fight me, small warrior person!"
"Good thing I don't bleed."
"Magic goes in, might comes out."
"Crunch!"
"Hmhm, people break."
"I. EAT. MAGIC!"
"We don't have to fight. Let's do though!"
"Honor."
"Justice."
"Stone cold."
"Punching time!"
"Hahaha! This never gets old."
"To battle!"
"Yes!"
"It's punch o'clock!"
"Boom!"
"Well, hello there, handsome."
"At last, a worthy opponent."
"Well met, giant zapping man!"
"I got the big guy!"
"There is only room for one of us."
"What are you looking at?"
"Heh, stone on stone!"
"You're a sentinel? I'm a sentinel! We should fight!"
"It's like a weaker version of me."
"Let us make violence, fellow rock man!"
"My wings versus yours. Let's go!"
"Hello beautiful, what are you doing here?"
"Greetings fellow large thing, let's fight!"
"Now this will be a fight for the ages."
"Yes... now that's a fellow I can punch!"
"Wing blast!"
"My wings, your face!"
"Feel the whoosh!"
"Wing punch!"
"Feel the breeze!"
"Blow it down!"
"Flap!"
"Wind!"
"Whiff!"
"Both wings!"
"Goin' somewhere?"
"Don't have long, let's fight!"
"Haha, come here!"
"Let's get rowdy!"
"I can take it!"
"Pick on someone my size!"
"Fight me! Now!"
"Gotcha!"
"Step right up!"
"Take your shot!"
"I'll take you all on!"
"Come get some!"
"Let's do this, then!"
"Take the first swing!"
"Whammo!"
"Uppercut!"
"To the chin!"
"Better bite down!"
"Punch!"
"Aha!"
"Fist!"
"Crack!"
"Bustin' heads!"
"Up you go!"
"Lights out!"
"Haymaker!"
"Knuckle up!"
"Get your guard up!"
"To your face!"
"Freedom punch!"
"Hammer fist!"
"And back!"
"Big blast!"
"That's it!"
"Smash!"
"Right!"
"Hi, everybody!"
"Eww, dead guy in my toes."
"Too easy."
"Squish."
"Vanquished!"
"Like a bug."
"Splat."
"Next!"
"Oops! Friendly fire."
"Squish, squish, squish!"
"Ooh, that was glorious."
"Who's still standing?"
"Hahahaha, did we win yet?"
"Hehehe, I like buying person things."
"Hmm... doesn't come with instructions."
"I don't know what this is. I bet it's great though!"
"That builds INTO something."
"Haha! Tiny."
"Hmm... looks red."
"To plug my cracks."
"Can I exchange this for a size seven-thousand?"
"Hmm... it doesn't fit. Well, guess I'll just hold it."
"Armour, kinda makes you feel like you're made of stone."
"Cloth will protect my rock hard skin!"
"Eh, never been much of a reader."
"Smashing power amplified!"
"A book! Oh, just need someone to turn the pages for me."
"A paginated collection of words!"
"Glacial? Oh, that sounds big."
"From the frozen loom! Whatever that is."
"Protect me, tiny ice shield!"
"Haha, ice fist!"
"So cold, yet it makes me feel all warm inside."
"Unleash your power, magic frozen fist!"
"Punchy spikes!"
"Make me stronger, purple zapping stick!"
"Rod of Ages? Hm, sounds old."
"This is perfect! I too am very old."
"I'll use it as a toothpick!"
"Might need to loosen that a few hundred notches."
"Belt's a... little tight."
"Looks dangerous... let's fire it up!"
"I know, I'll wear it as a ring!"
"Oh, I hate to miss out on the action... "
"Everyone stay put, I'll be right back."
"Phew! I'm tired of punching."
"Time for some fresh mortar."
"Demacia calls."
"Need a break from clobbering."
"I... crumble... "
"Mend... me... "
"I am cracked... "
"How long was I out?"
"Ah, how'd I get back here?"
"Okay, new battle!"
"Well, we lost that one. Let's go fight something else!"
"What happened? Was it a frost troll again?"
"I am chiselled anew."
"Hey, I remember this place."
"People are funny. They all say the same thing, "But I was a good person!""
"I'm all that stands between this world and a billion wicked souls."
"I smell sinners. Oh, this is going to be fun."
"This tour of the underworld begins - with my fist."
"Let's go damn some stuff!"
"There are so many circles of Hell... I love variety."
"My favourite are liars. Their screams are  so  sincere."
"We forge our own chains."
"All must pay for their transgressions."
"There are no lies... when your soul is laid bare."
"Ninth circle, traitors and betrayers."
"Kill 'em all, and let me sort 'em out."
"Ah, the sweet sound of gnashing teeth."
"This gate swings one way."
"Heaven?" Galio laughs. "Nobody goes there."
"My work is never done."
"Circle seven, pool party! Just kidding, it's more torture."
"Everyone sins."
"The worst part of Hell is knowing you'll never leave."
"I wish they'd chisel me a victim. Someone who won't break."
"Can you smell what the afterlife is cooking?!"
"If I were mortal, the last thing I'd want to see is me."
"Did somebody order some ironic punishment?"
"Think of it as Heaven, but... exactly the opposite."
"I am the last thing they see - before torment."
"So who wants their tongue ripped out with hot pincers?"
"Circle eight, bottomless pit."
"Nobody's perfect. That's why  everyone  goes to Hell."
"I do accept tips, but, uh... why would you?"
"Good thing I don't die."
"I fell in love with an iron maiden once. Big hugger, that one."
"Hellfire beneath my hooves."
"He goes, "You shall not pass!" Ha! Know what I did? I passed."
"Everyone gets what they deserve."
"Perdition waits for no-one."
"Ah, I can't decide what's more fun! Sending them down, or keeping them there?"
"Eternity is a long, long time."
"I'm an even worse guy once you get to know me."
"My ears are ringing from all the screams."
"I've been thinking - I should really get a rack."
"Free impalements all around!"
"Do not talk to the condemned. It will only break your heart."
"Ugh, the damned can be so clingy."
"Me? Retire? Why would I stop what I love?"
"Mother said, "Follow your dreams," so I became gatekeeper to Hell."
"No-one's too good for a date with the devil."
"Hell is other champions."
"Screams are like snowflakes - no two are alike."
"Death is just the start of their agony."
"They damn themselves. I am but a guide."
"We serve cookies in Hell - and they've all got raisins."
"Yeah, you get used to the sulphur smell."
"Of course I abuse my power! What else am I gonna' do with it?"
"Do you accept souls of the damned as currency?"
"Selling arms to bloodthirsty killers... hmm, tut tut tut."
"You there! Sate my material greed!"
"Greetings, living crystal. I come to take your soul."
"A living crystal! I will kill it!"
"A living crystal! I will make it scream!"
"Hope you had a fun life! You're about to pay for it."
"Welcome to the underworld, I have you down for the luxury suite. I'm kidding! It's all terrible!"
"You get a ticket to Hell, and you get a ticket to Hell -  everybody gets a ticket to Hell! "
"Don't worry, a thousand years of torture will pass before you know it."
"Ever heard of the pair of anguish? You will."
"Look, uh... I've been told I'm not a great friend."
"Just so you know - I'm stabbing you in the back the first chance I get."
"You know, gargoyles and Yordles have a lot in common."
"Gargoyle? No, I'm more of a demonic vessel of torment."
"Oh, oh, welcome home, my lord."
"You! Lust! Second circle!"
"You know what? Your life's already hell, so I'm going to leave you be."
"Didn't your mother teach you not to play with Hellfire?"
"Let your mom die, huh? Circle nine!"
"Pride! Circle eight!"
"Where do you think your soldiers go after they disappear? Yeah, who's the jerk now?"
"So if I torture you, the other you feels it three seconds later? Jackpot."
"My my, where do I start with you?"
"Wet the bed and blame it on your sister? Tut tut tut. Circle eight."
"You're gonna' love what we do to gluttons. They spend eternity eating themselves."
"You're gonna' love what we do to gluttons. They spend eternity devouring themselves."
"Have you been smoking? Circle three!"
"Worshipping false gods. Circle six."
"Being a weirdo tree hugger. Circle one."
"You're a Jarvan? I swear I've got at least three others down there."
"You get an eternity of watching someone else's play, so you know how it feels."
"You're an angel? Okay, if you say so."
"You just bring them to me. What I do with them is my business."
"Such language! I'll wash your mouth out in circle seven."
"Hey glowsticks, I hear you want your wife back. Trust me, you are not going to recognise her."
"That light's not going to work where you're going, child."
"So you want to have a soul, huh? You sure about that?"
"Being naive! That's not really a sin, but... circle one!"
"Matricide, my my, well done! Circle nine!"
"Want to learn to play that thing really well? Maybe we can make a deal."
"Such vanity - I could lead you to Hell with a mirror."
"Time to melt your hands off, thief."
"Sneaking around, huh? Circle four."
"Circle eight? Smartasses."
"Buddy, you're gonna' have plenty of time to work on that one."
"My middle name is Judgement. Galio Judgement Judgement."
"I'll weigh your transgressions."
"Come, your punishment awaits."
"You earned this."
"Welcome to Hell."
"Hope you like brimstone!"
"Remember all that bad stuff you did? I do."
"Let me show you into your pit."
"A gift from below."
"Congratulations, you've earned a thrashing."
"There's a Hell  beneath  Hell for you."
"No point in praying now."
"Hail me!"
"Judgement!"
"Too late to repent!"
"I see your lies."
"So much sin... tut tut tut."
"Horror!"
"There is no return."
"This never ends."
"Wrath!"
"Accept your penance!"
"Mutilation!"
"Your weapons are of no use."
"Start screaming now."
"And Hell followed."
"This will hurt."
"Let's list your crimes."
"This is permanent."
"Sloth!"
"Gluttony!"
"Greed!"
"Pride!"
"Lust!"
"Hmm... I'll taste your tears."
"Envy!"
"Eternal darkness!"
"My punches are prophecy."
"This is your trial."
"Ah, to Hell with it."
"Fall, graven image!"
"A false idol!"
"I should get one of these for the underworld."
"You'll feed my fires, giant lump of coal."
"Hm. Don't know if you have a soul, but... "
"Guilty - of being a rock monster!"
"Hm. Not sure where we put rock monster souls."
"Nice wings. Think I'll take 'em."
"A cheap imitation of me."
"A beast worthy of the third circle."
"How am I going to fit you through the gate?"
"Your sins must be  especially  large."
"Damnation!"
"No forgiveness!"
"Torment!"
"Atone!"
"Lashings!"
"Anguish!"
"Penance!"
"Winds of Hell!"
"Inferno breeze!"
"Say farewell!"
"Winds of pain!"
"Abandon hope!"
"Feel the hurt!"
"You are awaited!"
"Take my hand!"
"This way."
"Come to me."
"I'll drag you down."
"Your fate is sealed."
"Don't run away."
"Yes... yes!"
"Suffer."
"Take your pain."
"Give me your hate."
"Judgement punch!"
"Hell fist!"
"Smack!"
"Burn!"
"Demon slap!"
"Feel it!"
"Immolation!"
"I come for you!"
"Mortals."
"Six-hundred-sixty-six and 0."
"You just got judged."
"Hell yeah!"
"Fresh meat for the underworld!"
"Another soul for kindling."
"Wow, it's getting crowded down there."
"The more, the merrier."
"Misery loves company."
"Always room for one more."
"Now that's something worth coveting."
"For my material desires."
"Root of all evil indeed."
"Do you deliver to Hell?"
"Wish they sold people. Oh well."
"Red is the rivers of Hell."
"I always liked red."
"To adorn my hellish crown."
"Cloth burns up on touch!"
"Cloth will protect my rock-hard scales!"
"Ooh, this itches. I'll send it to circle seven."
"A few more scales on my back."
"Imagine the suffering this will cause."
"Now with even  more  damnation!"
"I feel... slightly more evil."
"The powers of Hell... amplified."
"Hey, I know the guy this belonged to."
"Spectres don't wear clothes."
"I need this more than some dumb ghost."
"Oh, that's never going to fit over my wings."
"Somewhere out there is a naked ghost."
"Just like mom used to make."
"Hey, I recognise this!"
"To bad it'll melt in like, two seconds."
"Nice to feel cold for a change."
"Cold. Works great on traitors."
"A frozen fist of suffering."
"Stand clear! The gate opens."
"Well. Gotta' go evil it up."
"The underworld calls."
"Need to sharpen my horns."
"Hang on! Forgot my pitchfork."
"Hang on! Forgot to torture someone."
"Just remembered - left the Hellfire on."
"I smell... sulphur."
"To... ash... "
"Back to Hell... "
"Who will judge me?"
"No... I can't die... "
"Who will make them... suffer?"
"And the Devil shall appear... "
"I am  so  gonna torture the guy who did that."
"Oh. Right. Heh heh. I can't die."
"I return to pass judgement!"
"My judgement never dies."
"I return to this plane."
"An honor to face you!"
"Your success is well deserved."
"GG!"
"I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum."
"It's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and I'm all out of gum."
"
