"Fight for the First Lands!"
"Tyrant!"
"Let them come! This land will be their graveyard!"
"We 
will
 live on... Either in victory, or in the scars we leave on them!"
"They await my words... what should I tell them?"
"We stand on the bones of the ones who came before us. For them, we fight!"
"I have but one life to give for Ionia. I 
must
 make it count."
"Ready for takeoff!"
"Yup, they're ice blades. Don't stick your tongue to them."
"I have walked the silver plains and fished the rivers of grass. The land knows me."
"Remember what's been lost. Fight for what hasn't been."
"(Laughs) They thought they could tame our land."
"To live under a boot is 
not
 to live."
"My dance has 42 forms. They'll only see one."
"I carry a 
lot
 more than these blades."
"We are the children of the First Lands, and we will 
not
 be slaves!"
"I remember when I danced for fun."
"Live today like you're going to die tomorrow."
"What strange power works through me, I do not know."
"I move to unsung melodies and unbeaten rhythms."
"Zelos told the worst jokes... How I miss them."
"Never stop learning. There's always a form you don't know."
"If they capture me they'll kill me... (Laughs) 
If
."
"We do this for those who came before us, 
and
 those who come next."
"Ours is the land of magic, and 
that
 is worth dying for."
"Their weapons are great, but our will is greater."
"We are the 
only
 masters of our fate!"
"Do we want to be safe? Or free? The choice is ours."
"Better times there were, and will be again."
"Dance with what brought you: in this case, blades."
"I never meant to lead. I fought, and they followed."
"An ocean separates us... for good reason."
"Where they fell, freedom grew!"
"These blades were whetted on the bones of tyrants!"
"Act, and the whole world will move!"
"They'll know me as the last to lay down her weapons."
"They didn't kill us all!"
"The voices of my brothers still carry on the wind."
"I am both the tranquil sea 
and
 the tempest."
"A mastered weapon needs no haft."
"Stay ready, and there is no need to get ready."
"Each form has a name known only to the wind. At least that's what O-ma said."
"Ionia is our only home!"
"Be the leader they need."
"I am not unfriendly! I am a warm and caring person."
"Freedom has a demanding rhythm."
"I 
really
 should've stretched first... Oh well."
"They came for our magics. They'll pay with their lives."
"Harm no one... Unless they come for your home."
"None can do what I do... So I will do it."
"A single pebble may sink a warship. And a 
thousand
 pebbles... (laughs)"
"Peace must sometimes be bought with blood."
"There's a saying: 'Never fight Ionians on their home soil.'"
"Even if they kill me, they'll still have to fight the land."
"Peace requires two participants."
"My O-ma always said I had angry feet."
"Of course I can fight. I grew up with four siblings."
"I've never killed a person... just a lot of Noxians."
"Give them an inch, they'll take a kingdom."
"I once served the light, until it cast me out."
"The blades demand an offering."
"I pledged myself to darkness. It has called in the debt."
"Like a knife in the dark."
"I'm doomed to carry these blades... forever."
"Who will feed the night's spirit?"
"The rest of the plane? Eh, I don't need it."
"Bring them down from the inside."
"If the mission goes to hell, there's always the blades."
"If they find me, they'll regret it."
"Hurt and subvert - that's how I do it."
"Stay under their radar, and if that doesn't work, cut their heads off."
"The frost gave me life. Now it takes it."
"The cold? Eh, it never bothered me."
"This ice never melts... just like our will."
"Sharp and cold - hurts two ways."
"I have walked the ice plains and fished the rivers of ice... The ice knows me."
"Hope they brought armor... and a sweater."
"Peace is not perennial. It must be constantly sowed."
"The seeds of our order carry on the wind."
"These petals cut deep."
"Beauty can grow from the murkiest water."
"Where they fell, the lotus grew."
"They see only the flower, but these roots run deep."
"Father, mother, Zelos, O-ma, Ohn, Kai, little Ruu... None of them ever had a chance."
"I did not light my O-ma's lantern. I don't want her to see this slaughter."
"You do not know burden until you've seen a thousand people hanging on your every word."
"Can you not hear the music? I shall enjoy watching you trip."
"Raise a hand to us, and you'll find it missing."
"Here are our terms. You leave, and you live."
"We are all creations of the spirit. Still, I must kill you."
"Everyone has something clever to say... until the blades find their throat!"
"Where did you go wrong? Is there anything redeemable in you? It's time to find out."
"Keep your 'balance', ours is the only side that matters."
"Humans? Vastayans? We are all Ionians, facing a common threat!"
"Soon they will grieve in 
your
 village."
"Stop your flirting nine-tails, it's time to take up arms."
"I admire your spirit. Your attitude, not so much."
"In Ionia we have over 200 species of talking dragon. Sorry, not impressed."
"Ugh, your songs are impossible to dance to."
"We don't need legends to save us. We do our own fighting."
"Nice technique. I miss your old hair though. Why'd you change it?"
"Ioniaaaaaa!!! Hmm, that's me, if I was you."
"Ugh, your twirling technique is atrocious."
"Somewhere, a forest is missing its idiot."
"I'm about to cut your wind!.. Wait, n-not like that, I meant my blades are going to...  Never mind."
"Your 'peace' leads to nothing but extermination!"
"You claim to speak for the spirit, as if it doesn't move my blades."
"Your dances are good, but they lack a 
certain
... soul."
"You want redemption? Join me, and kill your masters!"
"You know what it's like to lose everything. So you know why I must fight."
"Lobbing poison from your ship doesn't make you a genius. It makes you a coward!"
"Really? Flying blades? Get your 
own
 thing, sister!"
"Make yourself useful! Return your crystals to the earth."
"Were you the one who brought the ravens? Because I think they just got caught in my blades!"
"Did you wanna lose the other one too?"
"For a 'brilliant tactician' you sure pick unwinnable fights!"
"Once an Ionian, always an Ionian. You'll never be one of them."
"You dance to your own rhythm, but the land is beating the drums of war."
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, no. (clears throat)"
"(Clears throat) Wai-wai- uh wait..."
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
"(Grunt of anger) Hang on."
"Contrary to what you've heard, I have a great sense of humor."

"Cut them down!"
"There is no retreat!"
"It's all in the footwork!"
"We 
must
 prevail!"
"Mind your form!"
"Always attack at an angle!"
"No room for error!"
"On your toes!"
"Spirit guide me!"
"Stay composed."
"This dance kills despots!"
"And... breathe."
"Oho... you've got lead feet."
"
Never
 surrender!"
"We are sharpest where we break!"
"Push them back!"
"We stand or perish!"
"Our time is now!"
"Shall we?"
"The blades fly in sync!"
"Show them 
no
 weakness!"
"Balance be damned... Wipe them out!"
"The dance begins."
"No appeasement!"
"Still mind, swift movement!"
"It's us or them!"
"Care to dance?"
"Careful - I hit back!"
"Give them 
no
 foothold!"
"Eyes up!"
"We 
will
 resist!"
"Look, a dance partner!"
"Strike fast, and without misstep!"
"For the fallen!"
"Slice through them!"
"Invader!"
"Leave this land!"
"Step with me!"
"Follow my lead!"
"You'll rue this day!"
"Suffer as I do!"
"Let's mutilate!"
"Who dares walk this land?"
"Clip their wings!"
"Time for a dogfight!"
"I said, tray tables up!"
"We have contact with target!"
"Time for some sabotage!"
"I'm spotted, engage!"
"True ice, true aim!"
"Freeze them out!"
"Behold - the avalanche of blades!"
"Brrr!"
"Hold your ground!"
"We do not die this day!"
"Cast off your shackles!"
"Keep your form! Move as one!"
"Press on! We can quit when we're dead!"
"Take out their necks! The heads will follow."
"Freedom is yours! Take it!"
"Make them remember, so they do not return!"
"Give me your all! I swear it will not be wasted!"
"I will not let them harm you!"
"Remember why we fight!"
"I do not want your praise. Just your sweat and your blood!"
"Dig in! This is where we make our stand!"
"To the last!"
"I will cut a path!"
"Shall we fight back?"
"For the bones of our fathers, and the temples of our gods!"
"Let me take the lead!"
"Stand strong! 
Nothing
 can break us!"
"You 
will
 be avenged, brave ones."
"Your sacrifice will not be in vain!"
"I survive. And now I must earn it."
"I will light their lanterns. They will see victory."
"And now... I dance alone."

"Leave none alive!"
"Now!"
"Remember the Placidium!"
"Cut them off!"
"Ionia calls!"
"Stop their retreat!"
"Ionia still stands!"
"Break their lines!"
"It's always the blade you don't see coming."
"Aaand back to center."
"Do try to keep pace."
"I dance on your grave."
"Perfection of form."
"They made their choice."
"Okay, I'm warmed up."
"I just love the way blood pools on ice."
"All things wilt in time."
"So pure, so lethal."
"Leave them, as a warning to others!"
"A fool forgets to watch his flank."
"A successful ambush!"
"Always mind your footing."
"(Laughs) Hope they learned their lesson."
"Bury them in Noxus! This ground will not have them!"
"One less tyrant."
"Killing you won't bring them back. But it still felt good."
"That's for my O-ma!"
"Grace bends where strength breaks."
"Checkpoint breached!"
"Doesn't fly, but it cuts nonetheless."
"A sword with a grip? How quaint."
"Throw it in with the others, let's see if it flies."
"Steals their life, like they stole our land... I like it."
"Gives life as it takes it... much like the Spirit."
"Such a sordid weapon... but effective."
"I don't care who made it, so long as it kills invaders."
"Woe to all who would harm us now!"
"The ultimate in homeland protection!"
"A beast of a blade for beastly foes!"
"Now watch the bastards fall!"
"Give all and the spirit gives back!"
"The blades are honed, let us test their edges."
"Land, name and nation. Long may they live!"
"Stay watchful, stay prepared."
"Look sharp!"
"My guard is 
never
 down!"
"Never again."
"The eyes are the first line of defence."
"This time, we'll be waiting for them."
"Always expect them."
"I know they'll be back."
"I'll draw them in, you take their flank!"
"Of course. I'll set the trap."
"Brilliant. They'll never see it coming."
"Yes! Catch them unaware."
"Right, hit them from two sides."
"Well, time to find my feet."
"We must stay moving! Keep them guessing."
"(Sigh of relief) Alone at last... I'll make the most of it."
"It's quiet now... time to find my own rhythm."
"When no one's around, I dance for myself."
"I am the great river, flowing where I please."
"Requesting permission to land."
"Time to bail out!"
"Coming in to refuel."

"The spirit revives me. I will

"This is far from over. We have not yet begun to fight."
"Ugh! Need to get my rhythm back!"
"It appears my dance continues."
"My form was off... Can't let them see."
"I bloom again and again."
"I fight for Ionia!"
"We defended to the last!"
"GG!"
