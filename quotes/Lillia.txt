"Me? A dream come true."
"They're scampering from me?"
"Humans cast a spell every night. Every time they fall asleep."
"The garden is filled with burls. The burls, with nightmares... Mother Tree, I'll remind them how to dream."
"You can do this, Lillia. You are a strong, capable dream fawn. A-and you have a big stick. A-and you hit people with it but don't really mean it! Sorry."
"Where are you, little lost dreams? I'll bring you to your home in the Dreaming Tree."
"I'm glad you're with me, dream."
"In my garden—the garden—there's a tree—the tree."
"Night's falling in my garden. Leaves rustle like sheets! Why is...no one dreaming?"
"A little girl, lying on her bed. Be brave, dream. She needs you."
"A festival of flowers? F-for me? Oh, not for me. Not for me."
"I met the strangest human in my forest. D-do you think they're here? I still have their dream."
"Spirit blossoms. Their petals are the tongues that allow the dead to speak. What happens when they're silent?"
"Oh, Mr. Root, you almost tripped me."
"When they say goodnight, do you think they mean it?"
"Every time I hold my branch, I see the tree with my fingers."
"I'll stay in the forest...until I learn how to use doors."
"A curly mind twists towards possibilities!"
"I'll just...look around for threats. Fifth time's the charm!"
"I'll face anything...b-but won't look it in the eyes. Eep!"
"A yawn is a smile before sleep."
"Day dreams, night dreams, mid-morning dreams, dusk dreams!"
"The beauty of the world beckons desires to be real."
"Time to out-trot my awkwardness!"
"How can I tip-toe, when I don't have toes?!"
"Dreams help more than gardens grow."
"When I'm quiet, I hear so many things."
"Quiet things are strong. That's why I'm whispering!"
"The humans forget so much when they awake."
"You'll be safe with me, dream."
"I like talking to you, dream."
"Every human has a little sparkle."
"Nothing cries louder than loneliness."
"Hold my branch with me, dream."
"What lies beneath the surface? We lie it down to see."
"I catch dreams so the humans can chase them."
"You have to close your eyes to open them. Wh-whoops!"
"Do you think day turns red because it sees night watching, o-or is it just me?"
"Dreams are funny things. Sometimes they have feathers, sometimes they are wooly, sometimes they lift me up like a bubble!"
"Everyone is so loud. They never say what they really mean. Really, really mean."
"Humans think trees stand so tall, but they're lying on the air. You can hear them snore, and they're creaking!"
"I want to meet a human...from over here. C-can they see me? Don't let them see me! I'm not ready! Eep!"
"Mother Tree used to have so many flowers. I hope you meet her one night, dream."
"I can't stop from hiding, from being alone. But maybe, possibly, dream, someone will be alone with me."
"Okay! Don't trip, don't trip—oops! Okay! Don't trip again, don't trip again—woah!"
"Every direction here is straight. Where you leave is always behind you. No wonder the humans are lost."
"My hooves are saying prance, but I-I...oh, too much pressure! Eep!"
"Dream, I'll tell you a secret." *gasp* "N-never mind. Someone might hear."
*gasp* "A leaf rustled! Is it okay if I hug my branch? Hug..."
"Don't see me, don't see me, don't see me, don't see me! See me."
"Well met! ...Is what I would tell them, if I wasn't already running! Eep!"
"Do you think we've met before, in a dream we've both forgotten? Wouldn't that be wonderful?!"
"Th-they see us, dream! Scamper!"
"Would you...maybe, possibly, perhaps...want to dream with me?"
"You, over there! Do you hear me? Not you. Your dream!"
"Your dream calls to me! I-I hope you don't mind. Oh, you mind, don't you?"
"Some come to the garden lost. Others, to lose themselves. Like you, Ahri."
"Ivern! Am I still your favorite sprout? N-not that I have to be!"
"You may have tasted...too much purple."
"Neeko, can you teach me why the humans hide what's inside? Or...should I ask your flower?"
"You've spread like a shadow no one sees–because it's within themselves!"
"Nightmares are desire turned inside out, and upside down, and..." *gasp* "Oh, dizzy!"
"Running from problems won't solve them. But it makes me feel safe!"
"When he speaks, I hear your whisper, dream!"
"I feel your yearning. Deep down, it's what    he  wants too."
"Why would you want to remove your mask, Yone? It's great for hidin'."
"When trapped in fear, dreams become nightmares. We're fighting the same thing!"
"You bring many dreams, sparkly child, but also...much anguish."
"Time to be mean, Lillia! ...Did it work?"
"Oh hello, bird! What little whisps have you—A-a-a-achoo!" *gasp* "Oopsie."
"Sorry... Sorry!"
"Shush. It's the dream's turn to sleep."
"Dreams die when they're held too tight."
"Eeeep! I mean...eep."
"The magic is within you."
"I'm going in! For...some reason."
"Ow! Wait, I hit you?"
"Close your eyes so I can say hello."
"I knew you could sparkle!"
"I know how to use this."
"It won't stop swinging!"
"Your soul is blooming!"
"Hang on, dream!"
"All you know is nightmare."
"Whoopsie-lily!"
"Better a sleepy head than a sleepy heart."
"Whoopsie!"
"Whoopsie!"
"Ha!"
"Everything's so beautiful when it's real!"
"Look who's blooming now!"
"One hoof tra, two hooves tra-la!"
"Let's dance above the human snores! Hehehe!"
"Our world is so alive!"
"Our joy will plant a smile seed!"
"Every flower blooms to be seen!"
"So much to live, so much to love!"
"Dreams! Have you come out to play?"
"Don't be shy, Lillia. Be Lillia!"
"Bloom with me."
"Who can dream how a dream is born?"
"I'm prancing. I'm singing. I'm prance-singing!"
"It's like my roots are in the clouds!"
"There was never anything to fear...!"
"I and me are having a party, dream."
"I was sparkling the whole time, and no one told me?!"
"Let's find ourselves in our dreams!"
"Eep."
"I just had the strangest reality."
"Oh!"
"No one saw that, no one saw that!"
"Well met, human. Well left, dreams."
"Was...was that...me?!"
"I'm just going to go hide forever now."
"Sleepy time!"
"Sleeepy time!"
"Sleep well. Dream better."
"Dreams live on, even after the dreamer."
"Is this my nightmare? ...Or yours?"
"D-don't judge a flower by its bud, you!"
"Wake up! Wake up."
"You dreamed until you ached. Now do something about it."
"Oh! Are you alright, dream? Your light is so dim..." *gasp* Lillia falls asleep. "What's wrong, dream? Are you ready to bloom? Oh!" Lillia falls asleep. "When petals fall, dreams speak."
"When spirits mourn, the world blossoms."
"When humans sleep, spirits awake."
"Not good. Not good!"
"Do you think they'll remember me, dream? When they wake up, do they remember themselves?"
"Now I just have to wait for my confidence to regrow."
"Fall awake. Rise asleep."
*gasp* "I'm not wearing any pants! Oh...oh. So that's what human nightmares are like."
"Ill met."
"Is this my nightmare, or yours?"
"Are you my nightmare, or am I yours?"
"I met the strangest human in my forest. D-Do you think they're here? I still have their dream."
