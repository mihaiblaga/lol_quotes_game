"Embrace the darkness."
"Afraid of the dark?"
"I sense fear."
"Do I scare you, summoner?"
"Are you getting tired yet?"
"This place disgusts me."
"People are flames to be blotted out."
"Afraid of the dark?"
"Cross over."
"Swim in terror!"
"Are you my nightmare, or am I yours?"
"Bring me more flesh bags to slice up!"
"Weather forecast for tonight: dark, with a chance of pain!"
Nocturne laughs.
Nocturne laughs.
Nocturne laughs.
Nocturne laughs.
"Cut them from this world!"
"Suffer eternally!"
"Their twilight approaches."
"The light is fading."
"Drip drop, the sound of blood."
"Help is not coming... "
"All alone... " 
"Darkness... "
"Darkness... "
Nocturne laughs.
Beyond time we exist.
A dark cloud descends.
Ancient was our kind when this world began.
"Long have we waited."
"The end of days draws near."
"Fulfill destiny."
"A blight takes this land."
"What was, is, and will forever be."
"A trail manifests."
"We transcend time."
"The first are we. The last are we."
"We are one."
"Scanning... failure is your destiny."
"Beings of this plane are no threat."
Nocturne spins downwards like a drill and gets stuck in the ground.
"We see all. We know all. We are... stuck!"
"We have learned of spin to win, how none can stop--- it was a trick!"
Nocturne laughs.
Nocturne laughs.
Nocturne laughs.
Nocturne laughs.
"Fate cannot be averted."
"So it must be."
"No further meddling."
"Despair in our presence!"
"Their impudence ends."
"No recourse for survival."
"They are right to fear."
"Deprive them of life."
"They pose unacceptable risk."
"Their existence is a mistake."
"Oblivion."
"Pierce the veil."
Nocturne growls.
Nocturne laughs.
"We disengage."
"We shall restore."
"To the point of origin."
We continue.
We persist.
Divert us not.
Our time is without end.
We are infinite.
The path beckons.
"We have no beginning. We have no end. We are infinite"
"It's a trap!"
"Organic life is nothing but a genetic mutation, an accident"
"The time of our return is coming"
"We are legion"
"You cannot escape your destiny"
"We fight as one"
