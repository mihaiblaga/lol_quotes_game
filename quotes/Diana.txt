"A new moon is rising."
"Ignorant thralls!"
"Chosen of the moon."
"They would not listen."
"I will be heard."
"Dusk approaches."
"Follow no false light."
"I cannot turn back."
"The moon also rises."
"My eyes are open."
"I speak only truth."
"They could not break me."
"Embrace the night."
"
"
"The moon will rise. The night will last forever."
"A man, a woman and a  yordle  walk into the sun. They die! Because it burns them alive? Heh heh heh heh."
"Knock, knock. Who's there? The moon... it's far away! You were alone the whole time! Ha ha ha!"
"This is necessary."
"Ignorant thralls!"
"Bring down the sun."
"They leave me no choice."
"Deny me no longer!"
"Blind to the truth."
"No more lies."
"Nightfall!"
"Dusk!"
"Twilight fades!"
"Night approaches."
