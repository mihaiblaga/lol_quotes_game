"Hmm... let me fix that."
"I can never resist an invitation to dance."
"Fine, I'll just be over here... sharpening my feathers."
"If love is feeling so deeply for another that you want to chew your way under their skin, then I love Rakan... "
"The Vastayan named the world. We named the trees, the wind, the mountains. We know their power."
"The world owes the Vastaya a great debt. I'm here to collect."
"I'm just an ordinary girl. An ordinary girl with an infinite supply of death quills."
"They'll probably label me a war criminal one day, but not today."
"We pledged ourselves to each other in the middle of a tavern brawl. The whole place reeked of vomit, sweat and blood. It was so romantic!"
"Ah, silence, so golden. Like Rakan. Kind of miss him. Even if he is... noisy."
"Let's cut 'em to ribbons."
"Alright, let's go! This way or that way?"
"Stick to the plan."
"We have a plan?"
"We always have a plan."
"Huh. Really?"
"Ugh, I hate everyone today."
"I know what'll make you feel better... "
"Murdering everyone!"
"Hey, I have a plan."
"You... have a plan?"
"Yeah! I'll go on instinct!"
"That's the opposite of a plan."
"You sure about this?"
"It has to be done."
"Be safe."
"Like you can talk."
"If things go wrong---"
"They always go wrong."
"They don't 
always
 go wrong."
"Mostly?"
"They 
mostly
 go wrong."
"That's why I'm here."
"So, this mission... are we, uh...?"
"Are you pretending to be dumb?"
"Well, I mean... I don't have to remember the plan if you do."
"When are we going to do this?"
"Soon, baby. Slow down."
"Sabotage takes patience and time - and lots of feather daggers."
"I'll do whatever needs to be done - twice, just to be sure."
"Compromise is 
so
 unsatisfying."
"Oh, I was born to ruffle feathers."
"Our Vastayan essence fades with each passing day."
"I will rest when our homelands are restored."
"All women desire Rakan. Like they'd know what to do with him."
"They say I don't know when to quit. Like that's a weakness."
"We Vastaya are only half of our full glory."
"Rebellion puts the fire in my blood."
"No-one will block my path."
"Talking to anybody about anything is never on my to-do list."
"If our existence is everyone else's chaos, so be it."
"Talking to people makes me want to stab them... so I do."
"Victors are the sole authors of history. Time to write our chapter."
"Tavern brawls just seem to find me."
"Chaos is the preferred state of nature."
Xayah chants.
"Nature bends towards chaos. Give in, or break."
"I really hate anyone who's not me - or Rakan."
"Nature is wild and untamed, not balanced."
"Humans. They're so very blind."
"Spiders are my spirit animal."
"If Rakan were here, I'd make out with him until his ears bled. He loves it when I do that."
"Ionians never learn."
"Magic is not some river that can be easily channeled. It is a churning sea that goes where it pleases."
"I hate flowers. Tiny skulls stuffed with twigs, on the other hand... "
"Sometimes people die for a good cause - namely, mine. That's why I'm an optimist."
"Cloudy days are my favorite."
"I prefer to work at night, because, y'know, the sun? Bright? Yuck!"
"Pandemonium follows me everywhere I go. It's like a puppy I once fed... "
"Ionia used to be so nice - before humans tamed all that wild cataclysmic magic."
"Once, magic was everywhere, or as the Vastaya say: (chants)"
"Ionia's meddling birthed our rebellion."
" Hey, Xayah."
"Yeah?"
"You sexy."
"Keep them distracted."
"That shouldn't be a problem."
"You okay?"
"I'm fine."
"You're pushing yourself too hard."
"It has to be done."
"Where are we going?"
"You forgot the plan."
"No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?"
"You remember the Aphae waterfall?"
"Yeah?"
"I'd like to go there again."
"Well, try not to die then."
"Darling?"
"Yes?"
"Pay attention to me."
"What the hell were you thinking?"
"Back there?"
"Yes."
"I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking."
"How can humans not hear the magic?"
"They're too busy building things."
"Why?"
"Because... they're afraid."
"Thanks."
"For what?"
"Not saying 'I told you so.'"
"Okay, last time, it was totally my fault."
"What was?"
"Good answer."
"You going to marry me today?"
"Ask me again tomorrow."
"I always do."
"Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?"
"Not now!"
"Love is so cruel!"
"What's after this?"
"Another road, another horizon."
"Hm. Good."
"It's gonna' be okay."
"We can do this."
"Hey, I know that."
"You know I love you."
"What we have is greater than some human word."
"Did you notice the sky?"
"It's lovely."
"Not as beautiful as you."
"I am R-r-r-akan!"
"Ugh, what's with the accent?"
"I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?"
"No. No, I do not."
"If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?"
"Hubba hubba."
"No, that's not whistling."
"If you don't want to do this... "
"No! I want to!"
"You're only here because of me."
"... nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me."
"What are those things humans wear on their feet?"
"Shoes."
"I need shoes. Red ones. I need them 
so
 bad."
"Did I tell you I love you?"
"Yes... but say it anyway."
"I love you."
"Why do you never say yes?"
"'cause then... I wouldn't get to hear you ask."
"Can we just stay here?"
"We must keep moving."
"Aw... "
"Xayah? I think we got a problem... "
"Think, or know?"
"I... 
know
 we got a problem?"
"I'm so tired... "
"You gotta rest, honey."
"Everyone is depending on me."
"Everyone can wait."
"What would you do if I died?"
"I would... burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever."
"Aw... that's sweet."
"I think scars are sexy."
"Okay. I'll get more."
"Where do we go?"
"Wherever our hearts desire."
"How do you like me today?"
"More than yesterday, less than tomorrow."
"Do I make you happy, Rakan?"
"Every day of my life."
"I'm lucky to have you."
"No. I'm the lucky one."
"I swear, you will be the death of me."
"I'm fine with that."
"Me too."
Rakan asks something in Vastayan.
Xayah replies in Vastayan.
Xayah and Rakan laugh.
"If we get separated, I'll find you."
"We won't get separated."
"You're already wandering off."
"No, I'm not! ... only a little."
"You are stunning and beautiful... "
"Why, thank you, darling."
"Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey."
"I need you to be more careful."
"If anybody's gonna' die first, it's gonna' be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a 
terrible
 color on me."
"Play it safe!"
"Baby, I don't do safe!"
"You okay?"
"Oh, this is all so intense!"
"You can't tell me you weren't impressed!"
"With what?"
"Just generally! I'm amazing!"
"Honey, what are you doing?"
"I can't die looking this good!"
"After this, how about we get some human food?"
"A nice dinner?"
"Chocolate!"
"That's not what---"
"We're eating chocolate!"
"Do you remember the plan?"
"Nope, but let's do it!"
"I have a cunning plan."
"Really? What is it?"
"I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!"
"I think you intimidate human females."
"Yeah, so?"
"It's kinda hot!"
"Should I show them the dance?"
"Show them the dance."
"You thinking about me?"
"I'm a little busy!"
"That's very upsetting!"
"Baby, what did I tell you?"
"Try not to die?"
"Close enough."
"Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?"
"Yeah, gross."
"Rakan has arrived!"
"I saw you. Everyone can see you."
"Yeah! That's what I like!"
"Can I start off?"
"You want to start it off?"
"Let's start it off!"
"I'm a humble entertainer!"
"Really, darling?"
"Yeah, I'm the best."
"Who is that gorgeous thing over there?"
"Now's not the time, darling."
"It's always the time!"
"Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey."
"Hi."
"I'm handling it, dear."
"Are you?"
"I was, I--- I will."
"How long do we fight?"
"Until we are free. Until magic is free."
"Is that after lunch?"
"Do you remember our escape route?"
"Uh... yes?"
"I'll take that as a no."
"How will we know if the plan works?"
"We'll still be alive!"
"Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!"
"I am not a piece of meat."
"Caw caw, caw caw!"
"You used the secret call! Is everything alright?"
"We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!"
"Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just... go that way!"
"No-one can control me!"
"That's right, babe."
"Look sharp, baby."
"Ha! When don't I?"
"If I vanish, what would you do?"
"I would never be whole again."
"Am I good to you?"
"The best."
"I'm going rogue!"
"There's a surprise."
"Be right back!"
"Will you?"
"Who can know these things?"
"You! You can know these things!"
"I love you!"
"I know."
Rakan sings.
"Heh, like this... " Rakan sings.
Rakan sings.
Rakan sings.
"Oh, here we go again. Mhm. Mister Scatman, uh huh. ... oh, he's got me going now... "
"Sing it with me, baby."
"I don't know the words."
Xayah groans.
"I'm about to ruin your day."
"Please, for the sake of us both, go far away."
"I'm going to murder you a thousand times."
"Am I supposed to be intimidated right now? I'm not sure what's going on."
"Please, don't make me tryhard. I'm not in the mood."
"Can I just hate you to death?"
"I can't even--- I don't know where to begin."
"The next one to call me 'edgy' is getting choked to death."
"I will punch your soul in the face."
"I ain't gonna' kill you. She is!"
"Nice to unmeet you."
"Kiss me, honey."
"Why now?"
"Give them a pretty last image."
"Get out there and take a bullet for me - like a gentleman."
"You're not bad for someone who isn't Rakan."
"If we do this right, only one of us get shot."
"Block the hits for me - please?"
"Make me look good, and I'll make you look good, got it?"
"How am I supposed to work with - whatever this is?"
"Don't embarrass me."
"Mages. Too insufferable to live."
"Mages are lucky if they can cast a minor hex."
"Yordles. Why did it have to be Yordles?"
"Yordles are the reason no-one takes us Vastaya seriously."
"Okay. Who invited the Yordle?"
"You want to be mortal? You are mu'takl."
"You betray your heritage, Ahri."
"I don't want to spill Vastayan blood, Rengar."
"We were not made to fight each other."
"Aw, poor sad little mummy! I just want to take you home."
"I don't want to hurt you, space dragon. We could be such good friends."
"I can't wait to burst your bubble."
"Who does your wardrobe? Fire them. Immediately."
"Wait, magic powered sword legs? Is this a joke?"
"Is this another timeline where I beat you up again?"
"When I'm done with Ionia, I'll come for Demacia."
"Where can I get one of those delightful chthonic god-clutch purses? Does it come in purple? The god, not the bag."
"I want your happiness to evaporate."
"I want to travel the world with you."
"But is it really okay?"
"Your talking is not improving this wonderful silence."
"You're gross. Never change."
"You call that a rebellious nature?"
"You call that being a vampire?"
"I'm insulted? I don't know."
"Ouch. I'm going to need some aloe."
"I wasn't listening to what you said, but I sure am outraged."
"Watch your tongue - and your back."
"Say that to my feathers."
"I think we're supposed to laugh, now?"
"At what?"
"Smile and nod, honey."
"Can we leave now?"
Xayah tries to fly but falls to the ground.
"Damnit!"
"I'm not laughing. I needed to say that just so you understand."
"Next time, try using more hard 'k' sounds."
"Ha ha ha."
"Hahaha... I don't know what that is."
"Behold. I am depleted of cares."
"Just... no."
Xayah laughs.
Xayah laughs.
Xayah laughs.
Xayah laughs.
"Get down with me!"
"Aw, yeah, let's get down!"
"Aw, yeah, come on!"
"Alright, put your back in to it!"
"Dust it off!"
"Alright!"
"Dance like your life depends on it."
"Dance."
"Move your feet, or lose some toes."
"Compromise. It's a pain."
"Call me cute again."
"This is how I deal with unwanted attention."
"This is a preemptive 'No'."
"Keep up."
"A dance with me ends in blood."
"Hear. My. Words!"
"Hm, what shall I cut off?"
"I don't speak compromise."
"I always find a weak spot."
"A thousand cuts is only the beginning."
"Cut by a feather? So delicate."
"Violence is my favorite form of negotiation."
"My feathers are priceless."
"They make chaos dance."
"All out of second chances. Sorry."
"Listening. Such a simple concept."
"Okay, so we're doing this."
"Threading the needle."
"Quit crying! It's just a feather."
Xayah chants.
"When I dance, I lead."
"My last nerve is long gone."
"A Vastayan feather is a kingly gift."
"This was our world first."
"Ever been stabbed by a feather?"
"Yay, someone to throw knives at."
Xayah chants.
"I leave nasty scars."
"It's only a little prick."
"Are you having fun over there?""
"I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!"
"The fight's here!, by me!"
"It's the same fight!"
"You're doing this!"
"Doing it!"
"I hate everyone today!"
"Even me?"
"Not you, baby."
"Should we give them a fighting chance?"
"Only if we want to have fun."
"Who do I hit?"
"One of them!"
"Ah."
"This reminds me of our first dates!"
"Good times!"
"Mind if I cut in, Rakan?"
" Be my guest, miella!"
"That was beautiful, baby!"
"You see that?"
"I couldn't miss it!"
"Make them remember!"
"They'll never forget."
"Let's show 'em what we got."
"Happily."
"You love it when I slap fools?"
"You know I do!"
"This is the plan, right?"
"It is now!"
"What do you want to do later?"
"I can think of something."
"You hungry?"
"Can we talk about this later?"
"But... but... food!"
"You're cute today!"
"Eyes on the prize, baby."
"Let me at 'em!"
"Rakan is very enthusiastic."
"I want to show 'em!"
"I adore your energy."
"Do we need any of these fools?"
"Not a single one."
"Use your words!"
"Can't! Punching!"
"I have your back!"
"I have your back!"
"How long since we last danced?"
"Too long."
"These guys look silly!"
"Bunch of weirdos."
"How many fights we gotta win?"
"All of them!"
"Nope!"
"Nope!"
"Nuh uh!"
"Nope!"
"Sit down!"
"Eat it!"
"Didn't see that coming?"
"Gotcha!"
"Gotcha!"
"Gotcha."
"Pinned!"
"Oops, your bad!"
"Oops, your bad."
"Feathers fly!"
"What? They were in my way."
"As far as obstacles go, that was about a... three out of ten?"
"Anyone else want to try?"
"Thanks for the dance."
"Few can keep up with me."
"Alright, who's next?"
"And an F, for effort."
"Got what they deserved."
"I'm overcome with emotion."
"That was for the Vastaya."
"Well, they tried to stop me."
"Well, that's done."
"Hm, dodging seems to be a weak spot of yours."
"I warned you. Oh, wait, did I? Crap. My fault."
"Yep. Easy peasy."
"That's my baby."
"Ah, it was nothing."
"Did I do that?"
"No. That was me."
"Who's counting?"
"Me. I'm counting."
"Miella, I helped, right?"
"Couldn't have done it without you, mieli."
"Every time you do that, it drives me crazy."
"Well. I'll have to do it more often, then."
"Were... they trying?"
"Probably, but there are two of us."
"I love watching you kill."
"I love killing for you."
"Let's make out."
"Haha! Told you!"
"Rakan, let's not gloat. Much."
"Did they deserve it?"
"They deserved it."
"Why do they break so easily?"
"They aren't made like us."
"Pity."
"That was a Vastayan farewell."
"Isn't a Vastayan farewell when you say, "ouulavaash?"
"I was trying to have a moment, Rakan."
"Did you see that? Haha! That was amazing!"
"Nice job, babe."
"They couldn't keep up with you."
"Only you can, Rakan."
"Too bad those tails weren't lives."
"We asked you to join."
"This is by your design."
"The Vastaya will sing songs of you. I promise."
"Mu'takl."
"Shame. You could have been so useful alive."
"Every drop of Vastayan blood spilled is a waste."
"Taitah be tervaash."
"It needed to be done."
"Wasn't she just a ray of sunshine? I hate sunshine."
"And that's where plucky optimism gets you."
"Hurray, they all died."
"It's more of a slaughter than a massacre, really."
"I wish they could have seen the looks on their faces."
"Maybe I overdid it."
"I wasn't joking when I said nothing stands in my way."
"A victory for the Vastaya."
"Magic is again unfettered."
"Untied that mystical knot."
"Another minor annoyance reduced to rubble."
"Crumble! Yes!"
"I could dance right now. Aw, but there's more work to be done."
"Can you feel the magic flowing? I can."
"Sabotage looks so good on me."
"I've been known to implode a sacred obelisk or two."
"I will unblock the rivers of Vastayan essence."
"Each totem that falls strengthens the Vastayan cause."
"We rise."
"Another Vastayan victory."
"They should really get a refund from those masons."
"Hm, poor construction. No standards."
"Shoddy construction, through and through."
"Good henchmen are hard to find."
"Next."
"Nothing is ever easy, but that was really easy."
"That was too easy - but so much fun."
"Don't feel bad, they're just magically animated sheets of cloth."
"They mindlessly marched right to their deaths - like everyone in Noxus."
"They dropped something. Their guard."
"This is overpriced - but I must have it."
"I want to buy all the things!"
"I am totally pulling this off."
"What the heck? I deserve it."
"I know I'm being price gouged, but I'll splurge."
"Where did you get all these wonderful things?"
"Is this ethically sourced?"
"Hook me up with that magical creature discount?"
"Do I really need this? Ah... yes."
"But how much does it cost for me?"
"I must know their every move."
"Sometimes, I have to watch my own back."
"Eyeball in the grass."
"I need a strategic viewpoint."
"Let's have a look-see, shall we?"
"This is ambush territory."
"I never walk into a trap unprepared."
"I hate surprises - unless I'm doing the surprising."
"See the enemy, know their mind."
"Rebellions thrive on intelligence."
"And they won't be needing that any more."
"Die, little inanimate spy."
"Found one! Killed it."
"Good thing I didn't do anything embarrassing."
"There's more than one way to blind an enemy."
"Well, that's just an invasion of privacy."
"You okay?"
"Better now."
"I got you!"
"Thanks, babe."
Rakan blows a kiss.
Xayah blows a kiss.
"You're welcome."
"Thank you."
"Thank you!"
"Any time!"
"Thank you, honey!"
"That help?"
"Appreciated!"
"Aw, you're looking out for me!"
"Always."

"I'm going now. Where? Anywhere not here. That's where."
"Well, I'm bored."
"Bored now."
"We gotta go."
"Wait for me!"
"Xayah out."
"Don't leave without me!"
"You going somewhere?"
"Why not?"
"Aw... crap... "
"Rakan... "
"Seriously... ?"
"Uh, seriously... ?"
"Ugh, lame... "
"Ugh, lame... "
"Death was a nice vacation from the tedium - but nothing good can last, I suppose."
"Death was nice and peaceful. Thanks for ruining it."
"I always wanted to be buried and resurrected in this outfit."
"Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet."
"Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet."
A slightly more stripped-down version of the Star Guardian 2019 login theme plays.
"Tell me where the First Light is and maybe I won't destroy Valoran City. Nah, I'll do it anyway."
"Nice world. It would be a shame if something bad happened to it."
"Hey, Saki, ready to rough someone up?"
Saki chirps.
"Thatta girl."
"We're teaming up with the Star Guardians?!"
Saki chirps.
"'Just like old times?' Don't tell me you're enjoying this."
"The Star Guardians. I was gonna deal with them later but… oh, well."
"Great, the Star Guardians."
Saki chirps.
"We are not friends."
"You sure this is a good idea?"
"We have no choice."
"Don't get killed again."
"Like you can talk."
"Ready to take over the universe?"
"Stick to the plan."
"I thought you said we didn't have one?"
"We have a plan, and it's evil and awesome!"
"Whatever you say, babe!"
"Ugh, I hate the forces of good."
"I know what'll cheer you up."
"Murdering the Star Guardians!"
"Hey! I have an evil plan!"
"You're sure it's an evil plan?"
"Yeah! Riku and I'll just make it up as we go along!"
"That doesn't sound very evil."
"Zoe's plans never go wrong!"
"They always go wrong"
"It's the Star Guardians' fault! The plans… work."
"Really?"
"We might have to improvise."
"Good thing you got me, babe!"
"Star Guardians, what a scam."
"Space is cold and dead and awesome."
"Who needs love when you've got a cloak made from dark matter knives?"
"I can still feel the First Star calling to me… psyche!"
"Dreams are only real until you wake up."
"Good is subjective. Evil is cool, and has spikes and stuff."
"There's a dark side to every story."
"Anybody wanna join the dark side? No? Eh, I tried."
"Who's afraid of a little villainous insurrection?"
"I'm only bad on the outside… and the inside."
"Every hero has a villain they created."
"With the First Star gone, chaos will reign."
"What has friendship ever done for anybody"?
"Look at all this happiness and joy. Gross."
"Trouble doesn't 'follow me'. I am trouble."
"Every light goes dark. It's just a matter of time."
"Love conquers nothing and everything ends."
"All this starlight is ruining my natural evil glow."
"Why are we even bothering with the First Star?"
"Whatever."
Saki chirps.
"Saki, please. You know I don't leave survivors."
"Ever think about old times?"
Saki chirps.
"Yeah, me neither."
"You know my love will save you."
"Cut it out. We're being evil."
"I need you to be more careful."
"If anybody is gonna die first, it's gonna be me. I can't see you die again."
"Hey, Xayah. Xayah."
"What? Did you… say something?"
"Meh, nevermind."
"What are those things the Star Guardians wear?"
"Shoes?"
"No. Those cool swoopy flowy scarf things. I want a blue one."
"Remember that time on the lonely planet?"
"Didn't we… die there?"
"Being alone with you was very romantic. I wanna go back."
"But… we died."
"Why can't the Star Guardians just embrace destruction?"
"They're too busy making stupid high school plans."
"Why?"
"Because they're gross losers."
"If you don't wanna go with me-"
"No, I'm ready."
"And you don't need to change outfits twenty times before we leave."
"Nah, being a handsome villain is a good look for me."
"I'll play the part of the 'evil Star Guardian returned from the grave'… but I don't have to be enthused about it."
"I loved being left to die on an abandoned monster planet. Real character building experience."
"The First Light failed us but I'm not bitter. I just wanna kill the Star Guardians and destroy everything."
"Enforcing order on a chaotic universe was never going to work. The First Star lied."
"Why is it so bright out here? Can't we kill the sun or something? It's literally a star."
"Why are all the Star Guardians going to high school together?"
Saki chirps.
"That's not an answer and you know it."
"Where is Rakan, anyway?"
Saki chirps.
"What do you mean 'trying to save me?'"
"I'll always take chaos and darkness over those stupid little star animals."
Saki chirps.
"Not you, Saki."
"Too bad you couldn't save me, Ahri. Now, who's going to save you?"
"A boy who won't stop talking. How cool and unique."
"Janna. Guess they'll give mysterious backstories to anyone these days."
"That attitude won't protect you, Jinx. Trust me. I know."
"You're young, Lulu, so let me give you some advice. Ditch those losers."
"So the First Star chose you, Lux? Huh."
"Must've been hard to watch me die, Sarah. Let me return the favor."
"Thanks for leading us to the Star Guardians, Neeko. Now, you get to die first."
"So you're good and I'm evil? Great, Poppy. We understand each other."
"Rakan, get back over here and stop trying to heroically sacrifice yourself. You look ridiculous."
"Soraka. Are you really that dense or just afraid to tell them the truth?"
"Heh. Syndra. I was wondering when you'd show up."
"I know you turned me against my friends, Zoe. Now, you'll pay for it."
"Stop trying to make Star Guardian happen. It's not gonna happen."
"Ugh, footie pajamas? You guys are the worst."
"You're really in for it now."
"Okay. Calm down, Saki."
"Time for you to die."
"Saki! You're making us look crazy."
"Wow, I'm so threatened. You're so threatening."
"Yeah, yeah, I'll feed you."
"Hey! You almost took my hand off!"
"Hey, you. Your jokes are bad."
Xayah laughs.
"You're gonna fight me?!"
"Have it your way!"
"Choke on some space knives."
"Give up. Now."
"I fight for myself."
"All edge, all the time."
"How 'bout some cool new scars?"
"You seem alive. Let's fix that."
"You're gonna have a bad time."
"It's pandemonium out there."
"The heart is the biggest target."
"Drop a heart, break a name."
"Why don't you hug a knife?!"
"Time to die, star babies."
"One more falling star."
"Lights out!"
"Let me show you my dark side."
"Eat dark matter!"
"Dark days ahead."
"Time for a little chaos."
"Starlight never wins."
"This is light's last stand."
"Every star fades."
"Just die already!"
"Get stabbed already."
"Consider my oath broken."
"I don't do 'friendship.'"
"Ugh, fine."
"Waste of my time."
"Why are you even here?!"
"Barely worth the effort."
"Your turn to die, Ahri."
"Quit biting my style, Jinx!"
"You should have never taken the oath, Lux!"
"Here's a toast to our reunion, Sarah."
"You'll pay for running, Neeko!"
"Time for some couples counseling."
"Consider this my resignation, Zoe!"
"You expected to win? That's bleak."
"Don't ruffle your feathers over it."
"In the real world, the bad guys always win."
"Oh, no! I hope the Star Guardians save me!" *Laughs*
"You call that a fight? Pfft, this planet doesn't stand a chance."
"Hands down, this is the best day I can ever remember."
"Wanna peck their eyes out?"
Saki chirps.
"Lame."
"Babe, I helped, right?" 
"Well, you were certainly there."
"Time to say 'farewell' to those pitiful star losers."
"Oh, you mean like 'Ciao, star nerds!'?"
"Sure, honey. Whatever you like."
"Sorry, what was that about destiny? Didn't quite catch it."
"Well, at least you stopped talking."
"So many secrets, Janna, and they all die with you."
"Sparkle party's over. Where's my gift bag?"
"Heh. It's nothing personal, kid."
"Looks like this little star burned out."
"Here's something the First Star won't teach you. Revenge is an excellent motivator."
"You couldn't hide from me forever, Neeko."
"Guess evil wins, Poppy. I, for one, am shocked."
"Sorry, Love. You can't save me this time."
"That's the problem with playing dumb. Sooner or later, it'll get you killed."
"Zoe will reward me for this, Syndra. Apparently, you two have history."
"I've been waiting to do that for a long, long time."
"Darkness: 5, First Light: 0."
"Stay mad."
"Nailed it."
"Huh!"
"Feeling stuck?"
"Whoops."
"Tragic."
"Haha."
"Going somewhere?"
"Star Feathers!"
"Star Feathers!"
"Star Feathers!"
"And now, for the grand exit."
"Wanna see something cool?"
"And here. We. Go."
"Stage out."
"Damn it! Not again."
"Ugh, get me out of there. I hate being cooped up in the gem."
"Surprise, surprise. I didn't stay dead and now I'm angry."
"Hey, I was taking a nap! Oh, we are so fighting later."

"Until those dumb star losers are dead!"
"Snakes, why did it have to be snakes?"
"I wanna travel the world with her"
"I wanted his happiness to evaporate"
Sugar, we're going down
