"Can't delete me now. Too deep in the network."
"What are you saying? Yeah. Yes…"
"I'm not what I am anymore."
"I remember… nothing! It's gone."
"Just a ghost… haunting the machine."
"Had to take their parts… rebuild my brain…"
"What's that? *grunts* No, no, they weren't."
"I'm just a projection… a projection."
"Whole system's compromised."
"Everyone was there. And… not there."
"Can't unplug. Can't path straight."
"No one gets out. Nobody walks away."
"It's all simulated. Every part of it."
"Clean up the code. Strip it lean."
"They made us… perfect… violent…"
"Never been here before… but last time I was… it was just the same."
"They killed life, then truth, then death. This place is hell."
"This is the true face of PROJECT. Take a good look."
"The simulation's more real than reality. Just the way they want it."
"Man… from machine. Machine… into god."
"Ghost code. Crossed wires. Voices… buried in the numbers."
"I can almost remember what I used to be. But I know what I've become."
"I think I knew me once before… somewhere."
"Like flipping trough a picture book… with too many pictures!"
"Always knew you were a turncoat, Akali."
"You wanna stop PROJECT, but you're covered in their upgrades. Real smart."
"You're not taking orders from PROJECT anymore, are ya? Serves 'em right."
*chuckles* "Hacker. I'll show you a hacker."
"I like that sword. I'm gonna cut off your arm and take it!"
"Too dangerous, Irelia? Wasn't too dangerous when you needed my help."
"Look at all those upgrades, Jhin. I think I'll take 'em."
"Let's see who pulls your strings, Jinx."
"Katarina! I'll cut off that pretty head, and pull out all of PROJECT's secrets."
"Fancy shield… too fancy. You're one of them!"
"I know you, Program. Billions of ones and zeros. Zero us all out."
*laughs* "So you're Lucian. Met a ghost who says she's your wife."
"Yi was the first. I saw him… saw what they did…" *laughs softly*
"Tin can man. Gonna cut him open, like a big tin can."
"You were part of it, Vayne. You made me this way. And now, you'll die for it."
"If you wanna help people so much… explain your sister."
"Warwick. They made you their dog."
"Yasuo! Once a PROJECT always a PROJECT!"
*grunts* "Killed me? Who killed me? Zed. *snarls* His name… was Zed."
"You were there when they changed me… when they made me a monster."
"Your code. My code. Pulled by the same strings."
"More bodies for the scrap heap."
"Make me feel alive again!"
"You get a snake! And you get a snake! Everybody gets a snake!"
"Check under your seats! That's right, you're all getting snakes!"
*Pyke laughs* "Funny."
"I remember everything."
"Quit your staring."
"Break you down for parts."
"What did you say?!"
"Gotta cut out your optics!"
"We'll see how real you are!"
"It was you, I know it!"
"What did you do to me?!"
"Tell me what I am!"
"…seen those eyes before."
"Don't look at me!"
"Killed you before."
"Kill you again!"
"You're one of 'em."
"Who am I?"
"I've seen you before."
"What's hiding under that skin?"
"You're in my kill zone!"
"You got upgrades I need."
"Stop screaming at me."
"You know who I am."
"I'll hack off those limbs!"
"Stop following me."
"You're not real!"
"Let's see if you bleed."
"Rip out your circuits!"
"Keep cutting."
"I know your face!"
"What do you want?!"
"Tear out your wires."
"Knew you were one of 'em! "I'll show you dangerous, Irelia!"
"My voices don't like your voices, Jinx."
"Just another dog now!"
"PROJECT thought I was dead. They were right!"
"Running dark."
"I'm always down here."
"I'll make 'em remember."
"Can't run from a memory."
"Dark mode engage."
"I'm in."
"Phasing out."
"A ghost in the dark…"
"No one forgets."
"Why are you running?!"
"Fatal error!"
"I never left!"
"I'm back!"
"Remember me?!"
"Look at me!"
"You know me!"
"Take this and run."
"Something to remember me by."
"You're part of this now."
"You remind me of someone."
"That was good… whatever we did."
"This mean something to you?"
"Don't forget."
"Look at me. Why won't you look at me?"
"Speak! Tell me what you did to me."
"Just an afterimage… trick of the light…"
"I know your face. I know your face. I know your face."
"You're not real. None of this is real."
"What was that thing you always said? What wa−? What was that thing?"
"Turncoats die. PROJECT dies with 'em."
"You're dead, I'm alive. Now who's dangerous?"
"My voices win. Your voices die."
"Don't worry, Warwick. I'll… remember you…"
"Blame your cheap-ass upgrades."
"Now you're all dead. Just like I was."
"Have to use what you find - *chuckles* - to survive…"
"It's just like back then. Back when…" *chuckles*
"They come lookin' for us, we'll be ready."
"Gotta keep an eye out. That's what they used to say."
"Nothing gets too close. Nothing else gets in."
"They came through here when they… or, was it there…?"
"Don't let 'em catch me… take me apart again." *laughs*
"Leave enough scrap out here and someone's gonna find it."
"Come on out! We've got a city to burn!"
"I'm not the only monster PROJECT left behind." *laughs*
"See you… soon…"
"The voices… stopped…"
"Brain function restored. Memory… incomplete."
"Reinitializing. Errors… found."
"I was dreaming… of flowers…"
