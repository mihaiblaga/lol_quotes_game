"Flee like the cowards you are!"
"Don't worry, Bristle, I'll leave you the scraps."
"Those who oppose me get gored."
"Easy, Bristle. The archer's mine."
"Which will snap more easily? The bow, or you?"
"Ice Witch, prepare to be shattered!"
"Are icicles the best you can muster?"
"Who wants a treat? Bristle wants a treat? Not until we've trampled our foes to dust!"
"Can you smell coward, Bristle? Get 'em!"
"They will feed my boar."

"Those who oppose me get gored!"
"Hey, get up! How many times have I told you? No sleeping during battle!"
"Hey, wake up! No dinner for you, tonight."
"For my ancestors!"
"Trample them."
"Bristle, attack!"
"Run them down!"
"Strike at their heart."
"Leave no survivors."

"Stampede!"
"Trample!"
