"Sweet, we're here. Whoa, crazy weapons! This team's great. Let's go!"
"Zaun's with me every fight. This time's no different."
"You know what? We might die here. Let's make sure we go down swinging."
"Yell if you need backup. I'll be there in no time."
"Ayy, this is cool. Lotsa places to run. Charging up oughta be quick."
"Gotta hurry. People need my spark!"
"Quick feet, quick trigger."
"I belong here. We all belong here."
"Everyone's counting on me. No way I let them down."
"This won't be perfect, but life never is."
"No slowing down."
"I faced worse in Zaun. We can win."
"Ah, fresh air. A rare treat."
"If it matters to my team, it matters to me."
"Man, I should've packed more snacks."
"They're like the chem-barons. Talk big, but they'll break."
"I don't leave others behind."
"Anyone have a plan? No? No problem."
"Gun's not broken yet. Better keep it that way."
"Fight's gettin' messy. At least I'm consistent."
"Lightning in a gun coming through."
"Mistakes made are lessons learned."
"Giving up's too easy."
"Never seen so little traffic. Do I miss it?"
"Best thing I can do is fight when others can't."
"Do or die. I'm all in."
"Run fast, charge up, shoot the bad guys. Easy enough."
"I stood up for my community. I can stand up for others, too."
"Oh, wow. They're really out to get us. I gotta be faster."
"Grandma said 'Never back down from a fight.' Bless that woman."
"No one catches me. Except for my aunt. Man, I can't get anything past her."
"Blitz, you used to help me climb the clock tower. That arm of yours is no joke."
"A gun and a badge don't make you a hero."
"Ekko, you don't have to fight alone. Us Zaun kids, we stick together."
"Ezreal, you're the type of guy that's not worth my time."
"Professor, don't make me blow up your inventions again."
"Janna, you do exist! Your wind, my lightning. Let's make a storm. "Hoy, Jinx! How many rockets you making me dodge this time, huh?"
"Pretty songs don't fix problems, Seraphine. Actions do."
"A real rat with a crossbow? Can't believe I owe my Dad money."
"Vi, you could've fought for Zaun. But you chose not to."
"Is that another me? Or someone else?"
"No one's ever asked me to zap them, Ziggs. That's new."
"You wanna mess with us? Deal with me, first."
"That's a lotta talk. Let's see if you back it up."
"If I can just, uh, get this to work. Ah!"
"Nope. Not funny."
"A gift from Zaun."
"Ha! Surprise!"
"Electrocute!"
"Catch!"
"Heads up!"
"Need more power."
"Short on sparks."
"Come on! Charge already!"
"Running on empty."
"Gotta fuel up."
"Fully charged."
"Sparks ready!"
"Amped up!"
"You got nothin'."
"Step up!"
"I'm here!"
"Unload."
"No you don't."
"In a hurry."
"Incoming!"
"Burst fire!"
"Nuh-uh."
"Let her rip!"
"Buzz off!"
"Not a chance."
"Don't you dare."
"It's up to me."
"Count on me!"
"Dodge this."
"Quick, quick!"
"Pscht, get out!"
"What's up?"
"Drop!"
"Hoy, move."
"I'm not messing around."
"Electric."
"Outta my way!"
"Shock 'em!"
"Screw it, I'm mad!"
"Go, go, go!"
"No holding back!"
"All in!"
"Bolt 'n' jolt!"
"Static blitz!"
"Aim and fire!"
"Let it fly!"
"Ultrashock laser!"
"Here it comes!"
"Boom!"
"Ay, my bad."
"I'll get them, I promise!"
"Off I go."
"Bye!"
"Gotta zip!"
"Go time!"
"That's my cue!"
"See ya!"
"Lightning crash!"
"I am lightning!"
"Hoy! Hear that buzz?"
"Ready to shock!"
"Wow. Intense."
"Aw. Over already?"
"Whew. Gotta recharge."
"No one steals my thunder."
"You blinked!"
"Downed one!"
"And Dad said I was stubborn."
"Beat it!"
"Fried!"
"Got 'em."
"Ha! Got you."
"Too slow."
"I shoot back."
"Never count me out."
"Wiped!"
"Quite the swing, Blitz. Let's have another go."
"Well, Caitlyn. Out of touch, out of luck."
"You can do better, Ekko. Rewind and rematch."
"Liked your gauntlet, Ez. Everything else? Meh."
"Back to the blueprints you go!"
"Janna, come on! Don't let people's faith go to waste."
"That's enough animal-shaped guns for now."
"Beautiful lyrics, Sera. If only you'd backed them up."
"Twitch, if you want cheese-flavored trash, just ask."
"Vi, I've tried punching through life. Doesn't work."
"Probably a weird dream. Nothing to worry about."
"Do I smell burnt squirrel?"
"Look at them scramble! We crushed it!"
"Wow, we rock! Wait, where's the last one?"
"Woo, that's five! We gotta celebrate!"
"I owe ya one!"
"Appreciate it!"
"Thanks!"
"One sec! gun could use a little tinkering."
"Wait! I forgot something! Just stay alive, okay?"
"Hold up! There's a gear in the shop with my name on it."
"No! I can fight..."
"People need... me..."
"I'm not done..."
"If the chem-barons couldn't keep me down, no one can."
"Come on, Zeri. Fight to win, remember that."
"Snap out of it. I can do this. We can do this."
"Ugh, might've rushed that one. It's okay, I'll do better."
