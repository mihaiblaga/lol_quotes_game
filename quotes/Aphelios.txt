"So many weapons, Aphelios. The deadliest is your faith."
"Condemned to darkness, where our power grows."
"Aphelios… I hear you. I know what you sacrifice."
"Even from across the celestial veil… I will be with you, brother."
"It always starts with pain. We can only do this together, Aphelios."
"Your life upon the altar, brother… I will not betray it."
"With every step, two steps. With every breath, two breaths."
"Order fights for light. Chaos fights for darkness. In the moon, we have found both: a way to survive."
"We are meant to hate each other. But we will show them all, wicked and divine, that we are stronger together."
"Will they still call you 'fiend' when they die, looking in your eyes? Or will they see the savior I see, Aphelios?"
"You knew this would not be easy, the way forward written in scars."
"You walk the path of darkness, but you do not walk it alone, brother."
"Remember what you have learned, brother."
"When your steps falter, brother, follow my voice."
"Find your orbit, brother."
"Do not look back, Aphelios."
"You are the weapon the Lunari need."
"By my word, you walk into the night."
"You are not alone. Remember our promise."
"I am your sister. I am listening."
"I'm never further than a whisper echoing in silence."
"Even when I close my eyes… I'll never look away."
"I am with you… shining above."
"Through your eyes, I see such wonders…"
"Beneath the mask of silence… I know your true face, brother."
"Again and again, I see you reach… for me."
"How can I help you when I put your life at risk?"
"From our fortress, I will guide you. I promise."
"I beseech the moon to protect you."
"I am right. This is what the moon tells me."
"Walk where I cannot."
"We must find each other before every first light."
"We're in this together. Darkness and light."
"As light reveals our path, so will darkness."
"The brighter my light, the stronger your shadow."
"Darkness is not heresy. It lies within us all."
"We cannot let fear trap us in twilight."
"Our destiny is hidden in the night."
"The moon shines brightest in darkness."
"The dawn will know the night's silence."
"Each of us, an offering."
"All we ask is for a witness to our sorrow."
"We walk through violence. Born of shadow. Born of light."
"Even when the moon is new, it is there. A whisper to the shadows of your soul… I am with you."
"It is as the moon revealed, Aphelios. As beautiful. As terrifying."
"Our path is set between the last breaths taken by our enemies."
"You will make death more than death, brother. You will make it holy."
"We cannot touch the moon. But its light can touch us. Shouldn't that be enough? Light, on our fingers…"
"Without pain, we would not need faith. The moon would not need us. We would not need each other, Aphelios."
"The fortress is quiet. If only you could be here, Phel. You would make this stone seem loud."
"If pain is what awaits us in the darkness, brother… we must run to it, unafraid."
"What we want, what we need, what we must do… I envy the ignorant."
"The Solari call us heretics, but when darkness comes, brother, they will need our light."
"You cannot feel the tear running down your cheek. I cannot wipe it away…"
"Our thoughts touch… impossibly close. Which of us am I?"
"The fortress looms around me. It is everything. It is the only thing."
"You make yourself a weapon, so you do not have to feel. But you are not a weapon; you are my brother."
"Phel… You have made every movement a thousand times. Until you bleed. Until you do not have to think."
"The pain makes you numb. But I can still feel, brother. I know the truth that pain hides."
"I see further through the celestial veil. What we call truth is shadow."
"Our faith will be tested."
"We have no enemies, Aphelios. Only those fated to meet us in the night."
"Diana knows the moon's name, Aphelios. I can feel it on her heart."
"The aspect of the moon. What is she fleeing? What has she done?"
"Our aspect has returned… bringing darkness."
"Senna, in darkness, we find each other."
"Soraka knows our pain, yet tells us not to feel it. To deny ourselves."
"Yuumi is much friendlier when she visits me in the spirit realm, snuggling at my feet while I read Book and imagine the rain."
"We were born to twin destinies, to tragedy, as the sisters were before us."
"What do they hold if they only reach for the trigger?"
"The greatest power is the power greater than ourselves."
"To become a vessel for the heavens, one only needs faith."
"The moon is with us in darkness, but it is not there for us."
"The Solari do not see: we shine brightest with another's light."
"Hah."
"Hah."
"The power of your belief."
"Soul and skill converge."
"Through sacrifice, all things."
"By light, the moon speaks!"
"Believe, Aphelios."
"A reckoning in stone."
"We hide no longer."
"Night embrace you!"
"Weapons aimed by destiny."
"You have bled, so they will."
"Every movement, a ceremony."
"It ends in silence."
"Until night is everything."
"They orbit their end."
"You are the moon's eclipse."
"No thought moves your hand."
"This will be your voice."
"Your fight echoes even here."
"I send you… light."
"In your hand. From my heart."
"Reach out, Aphelios."
"Stone and spirit return to you."
"Blessings of the moon."
"For every phase, a weapon."
"An omen in your grasp."
"Carry the faith with you."
"Born of night."
"Calibrum."
"Moonlight will guide your aim."
"I will extend your reach, brother."
"The full moon reveals."
"Severum."
"Harvest death for life."
"With every slash, resurrection."
"The moon gathers darkness on the crescent's edge."
"Infernum."
"Cosmic flame will fill the night."
"Enlighten the many."
"The moon grows in flame."
"Gravitum."
"Darkness will weigh upon them."
"They will not escape what is coming."
"Their steps will falter in darkness."
"A new moon. The same darkness."
"Crescendum."
"An orbit of blades."
"Death, arcing from your hand."
"The half moon, perfectly balanced."
"I am with you."
"I am with you!"
"When you shine, the moon can worship. You did well, Aphelios."
"They are motes of dust, shimmering in moonlight."
"A prayer for their souls. Torn from the night."
"To make a life of death… you do what you have to, brother."
"Not even she knew what she would do. That was why she was afraid."
"The heavens turn toward darkness. Now is our time."
"Mother moon, guide them."
"Be careful, Phel."
"Phel, you're hurt."
"You will not suffer in silence."
"Blood upon still lips."
"Only one of us is safe."
"We bleed when we cannot cry."
"No, I was supposed to help you! I knew…"
"Phel… I'm sorry."
"I'll find you. I promise."
"As darkness falls, the moon rises."
"Out of darkness, the moon is born anew."
"I will not let you die."
"Faith, brother."
