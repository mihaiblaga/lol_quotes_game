"Fixing the world, one scoundrel at a time!"
"I'm going to remember this."
"So... this is what it's like to have friends."
"This cape is not up to Sentinel Code. But, neither is the grappling hook, nor the boomerang."
"Shadya would approve of this. I think. You could never tell with her."
"We are not helpless. We are the ones who shape our destinies. Now, let's go shoot these villains in the face."
"There is no such thing as fate. But there is such a thing as Akshan."
"The world won't save itself. You know."
"Sometimes fate just needs a little nudge."
"Things to do. Scores to settle."
"Can't talk. Sentinel business. Super important."
"How well I know the silence of a lonely life."
"Some people just don't want to pay with their lives."
"I've got quite a few tricks up my cape."
"Okay, villains. Time to soil yourselves."
"A villain will show you much when they don't know you are watching."
"He who takes a life bears its mark on his soul."
"Is it wrong to kill killers? Eh, I'll ponder that later."
"Death? I laugh at death! Ha! Listen to me laugh!"
"Huh, nice place. Lotta things to swing from."
"Just desserts coming right up."
"Curse this nagging conscience of mine."
"I hate shooting them in the back. I don't get to see their surprise."
"Who am I to decide who lives and dies? Huh. Just a guy."
"I do not break rules. I bend them. Ever so slightly."
"I live by my own code. Don't be an ass."
"Some people deserve a low blow."
"People without grappling hooks, what are they thinking?"
"I once knew someone who followed the rules. She's dead."
"Talk is worthless. We are what we do."
"Mmm, yes. Villainy is near."
"A scoundrel left alone will always be a scoundrel."
"Once they see me, it is too late for forgiveness."
"Ha ha! The thrill of going where you're not supposed to."
"Some people say I hold a grudge too long but... those people are dead."
"How does this boomerang return? Someday I'm going to learn its secrets."
"'Don't use the absolver', they said. 'No one must wield such a weapon'. Eh, I disagree."
"Not everything happens for a reason. Some things need to be sorted out."
"What else can I add to this gun? Maybe a shovel. No-a ladder!"
"It's important to stride into the wind so the cape flutters dramatically behind."
"Vengeance is not a healthy impulse. Here's to bad health!"
"I can feel them shaking in their armor. I love this part."
"Listen to them. 'Oh no, is Akshan coming to kill me?' Hahahahaha. I am!"
"Shadya would not approve of this act of vengeance but... she wouldn't approve of a lot of things."
"Here we go. Get in. Avenge fallen ally. Get out."
"You try to rest and some lowlife kills one of your pals. Such is life."
"The bad part about having friends? Always having to avenge them."
"A friend has gone silent. Let's wake them up shall we?"
"They take one of mine. I take one of theirs."
"I hear the dead crying out for vengeance. I am coming, friend!"
"Killing this person won't bring my friend back. Actually, it will! Let's go do that."
"Sorry, can't let you live. You understand."
"It's not too late to turn around you know."
"I've got something for you. It's... comeuppance."
"Well. You look very guilty of something."
"I don't know how you live with yourself, but you won't have to for long."
"I know what you're feeling. It's regret."
"Hey! Grappling hook buddies! No? Okay, suit yourself."
"I know you! You're that kid who stole the gauntlet."
"Well if it isn't sentinel serious. Look at all the rules I'm breaking."
"You're from Shurima? And have a boomerang? We should hang out!"
"Silly Viego, we can't bring back those we've lost. I mean, I can but... not you."
"Greetings, fellow sentinel! How strange that we are not friends today. Oh, well."
"You work with Viego, yes? Scoundrel by association!"
"I taunt with my grappling hook. See how it taunts you? Taunt, taunt, taunt..."
"That was very clever. I hope it was worth your life."
Akshan fires his grapple upwards intending to fly to the sky, only for it to fall short.
"Up, up and... maybe not."
"That was very clever. I hope it was worth your life."
Akshan laughs.
"You don't deserve life."
"Scoundrel!"
"Too late to atone."
"Take your comeuppance."
"Defend yourself!"
"You've been naughty."
"You're in deep, friend."
"This is when I shoot you."
"Eyes on the cape."
"I'm afraid you must pay."
"Oh come now."
"You know why I'm here."
"Tsk, tsk."
"Say your goodbyes."
"Any last words?"
"Vengeance with a smile."
"Confess!"
"Have you no shame?"
"I don't envy you."
"You earned this."
"All in the wrist."
"Ha! Boomerang!"
"Look at it go!"
"Watch it fly!"
"Sometimes, I even sneak up on myself."
"Ohohoho, I love sneaking."
"Stealth tiiime! I mean... stealth tiiime..."
"To the shadows... where the scoundrels hide."
"Ha ha! Their eyes cannot find me."
"Hey! I snuck in."
"Miss me?"
"Ha! I have you now."
"Knock, knock. Vengeance calling."
"Gotcha!"
"So... how's it going?"
"Ha! I have sneaked upon you!"
"That's right. It is I."
"I'm back! Take note, evil!"
"You're an easy one to find."
"There you are. Welcome back."
"You are reclaimed. Go! Live!"
"Yes, yes. You can thank me later."
"Reclaimed by the light! Yadda-yadda-yadda..."
"Go. And die no more."
"Have a good rest?"
"It was nothing. Really."
"Let's try not to do that again, hm?"
"Dear friends. Please stop dying. - Love, Akshan."
"Coming through!"
"Watch your head!"
"Heads up!"
"It's as fun as it looks."
"Akshan, away!"
"Whoosh!"
"Oh, so exciting!"
"Oh, the anticipation!"
"You're going to love this!"
"Here comes the 'uppance!"
"You know you had the coming, right?"
"Yeah. I'd say we're even."
"Now think about what you did."
"There, now everyone's happy. Except you."
"That was quite satisfying."
"Consider yourself... absolved."
"Always hard taking a life, but I get over it."
"Haha! They never except the grappling hook!"
"Now for my grand escape. Grappling hook!"
"Right, then. Up we go!"
"Like the mysterious boomerang. I always return."
"Only one way out of this mess. Skyward!"
"I come and go at unpredictable times. That is Akshan's thing!"
"Oh... I see..."
"That hurts..."
"Absolve... me."
"So... back at square one again. Let us proceed to a better square."
"Well, this is embarrassing."
"No shame in starting over. So I tell myself, anyway."
"Someone gave me comeuppance? Ha! Who do they think they are?"
"Yes, yes. The guy who revives people died. I'm really going to hear about this one."
"Shadya's frowning at me now. I should've paid more attention to her lessons."
